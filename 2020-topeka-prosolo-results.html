											Well that was a productive weekend! I left for Topeka
											Kansas on Friday morning after working for a few hours and
											stopped on the drive out for a few more phone calls that I
											needed to have. I stopped and went into two locations on
											the drive down, a QuikTrip in Wentzville Missouri, and a
											Chick-Fil-A in Blue Springs. The QT had no workers or
											customers (besides myself) wearing a mask. The Chick-Fil-A
											was still closed for indoor service and all staff were
											wearing masks while working the drive through lines.
										</p>

											I was able to get out to Topeka in time get the Falken
											RT660s mounted on the car and to get some practice starts
											in with the new starting lights that they have going this
											year. My first impression of the lights, they change
											everything. In the olden days for ProSolo, back before LED
											lights, I used to leave when the second light was “going
											off”. With the LED lights introduced in the past couple of
											years, I would leave when the third light was coming on.
											With the 2020 version of the lights, I had to wait until
											the third light was on and then start the process of
											releasing the clutch to get the car to move.
										</p>

										<p>
											My first pass at the lights I turned a .391 reaction time,
											where a .500 is “prefect, and anything less than .500 is
											RED. My second attempt resulted in a .744, not red, but
											definitely not in the .5-600 range that I expect when I’m
											starting. My third attempt was a .575 much more
											respectable. I ended up taking 8 practice starts, and
											while I wasn’t really happy with them, I felt at least
											comfortable enough for the weekend that I didn’t buy more.
										</p>

										<p>
											Friday night I took the car by the car wash, grabbed a
											Vegan Lifestyle bowl from Chipotle and ran around to a
											couple of liquor stores in Topeka looking to add to my
											whiskey/bourbon collection. Friday night I spent my first
											night in a hotel with social distancing and cleaning in
											place. The Hampton Inn had the rooms “tapes” off with a
											seal that said they were clean, if the seal was broken you
											knew it hadn’t been cleaned. The elevator had a sign
											outside of it requesting that only 2 people use an
											elevator at a time. Overall the hotel experience was
											great, except for the fact that it was completely full
											with pre-teens running around on Saturday evening,
											obviously a sports tournament of some sort brought a lot
											of kids in, without any masks to be found.
										</p>

											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											Saturday morning I walked out of the hotel with the front
											desk person saying “stay dry”. I thought, oh it is just a
											little rain, then the doors parted and I saw that it was a
											torrential downpour. I navigated out to Heartland Park,
											going about 45 on the highway due to the conditions and
											the RT660s feeling a little skatier than I would have
											liked on the highway.
										</p>

										<p>
											Getting out to the event site, I was my usual self, the
											first person out walking the course. By the time I
											arrived, it was still raining and windy, but wasn’t the
											downpour from the hotel so I walked in just the rain
											jacket and flip flops for shoes. Went through one area
											where the standing/running water was a good 2” deep, but
											overall managed to not get myself too soaked. There was
											plenty of wind damage around the site however.

											Saturday morning’s start was delayed due to lightning (as
											was Sundays) but by the time my group ran, it was pretty
											much dry, with conditions getting better as the morning
											went on. After the Saturday morning sessions I was sitting
											in 2nd behind Kinch out of Colorado. Saturday afternoon
											brought more of the same. I felt I was struggled on the
											right side course, where I felt a lot more comfortable on
											the left. Saturday afternoon I found .15 seconds on the
											left, and just over .3 on the right Saturday afternoon.
										</p>

										<p>
											My first run on Sunday morning I started on the right and
											couldn’t find any time, but found about .17 on the left,
											putting me within striking distance of Kinch. My second
											right side run I hoped I would find another couple of
											tenths but struggled and was .4 seconds slower than my
											best attempt on Saturday afternoon. Going into the last
											right on the left side I was pretty sure that I had no
											chance, and was going to have to settle for second place
											behind Kinch. I was pleasantly surprised when I came
											across on my last run with another .13 second improvement,
											enough to give me a .052 win over Kinch.
										</p>

										<p>
											This was my first ProSolo win.The car has won previously,
											multiple times, but for me, in twenty years of
											autocrossing, this was a first, and it was a blast!
											Winning your class in a Pro means you move on to the
											Challenge the second half of Sunday.
										</p>

												title="My first christmas tree trophy!"
											/>
										</p>

										<p>
											This was I believe my fourth attempt at a challenge, and
											likely the first time I’ve moved on passed the first
											round. I ended up paired up with James Harnish out of
											Arizona in the first round. I didn’t feel too great about
											my runs, but he ended up hitting a cone and that gave me
											the padding I needed to move on to the next round.
										</p>

										<p>
											Round number 2 I was lined up against Craig Wilcox. I’ve
											known Craig since 2003 or 2004 when we both raced 350Zs in
											B-Stock. He’s out of KC and has multiple national
											championships under his belt, while I, have none. Sitting
											at the back of the line waiting for the round to proceed
											Craig started running around debating on whether or not he
											needed to get gas for his SMF Honda, I selfishly started
											wondering if that might not play into my own advantage. It
											didn’t. If anything it took me out of my game. I realized
											just before pulling to the line that I hadn’t set my tire
											pressures. After round one I had gotten out and check
											them, but decided to set them closer to running. By the
											time I realized I didn’t actually set them, it was too
											late, I was strapped in the car and they were getting
											ready to send us to the line. I tried to put that out of
											my head and just head on out.
										</p>

										<p>
											My first run was once again on the Right side course. I
											fell asleep at the lights and left with a reaction time of
											.993 almost half a second off of the ideal reaction time,
											and three tenths greater than what I would consider
											acceptable. I didn’t feel great on the run, but it is also
											the slower side that I struggled with all weekend, I came
											back with a 1.001 deficit, almost .5 on the light, and
											another .6 on the slower course, I felt like that math
											worked. Going into the left side run I knew I was going to
											need to push it, and Craig might back off knowing he
											didn’t quite need to push as hard. I left on the last run
											with a .623 reaction time and pushed as hard as I could to
											try to find time. I looked across to the other course as I
											came through the finish and I was quite a bit farther than
											Craig, I hoped deep down inside that it was enough.
										</p>

										<p>
											Once Craig crossed the line the announcer stated that I
											had made up over 8 tenths, but not the full second I
											needed, so I was done and Craig was moving on to the next
											round against Kinch.
										</p>

										<p>
											Here’s the video of my best left and right side runs
											(Sunday morning and Saturday afternoon respectively). The
											left side run uses my GoPro Hero8 with stability enabled,
											on a fixed mount on the roof of the car. The right side
											run uses the same camera with stability, but on my
											rotating mount. I honestly don’t feel like there is a big
											difference between the two mounts with the “hypersmooth”
											enabled in the GoPro Hero8.
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											My drive home on Sunday was uneventful, changed tires,
											loaded up the car, and hit the road. I averaged around
											32mpg between Topeka and St. Louis, getting home just
											after dark so that I could unload the car and see the
											family before everyone fell asleep.
