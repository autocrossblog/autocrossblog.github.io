## Another blog from [Chris Hammond](https://www.chrishammond.com).

I started autocross fresh out of college in 2000. I had heard about autox from a fraternity brother of mine, and then from my dad who used to do gymkhana events in Missouri in the 60s, but I had never been to or seen an event.

I purchased a book about VWs, in it were stories and quotes from the Tunnels. I joined the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), got the Solo rule book, read it cover to cover, and started attending membership meetings of the St. Louis region. 

I signed up for the local Novice school, and was hooked. I bought started autocrossing in a 1994 VW Golf, it wasn't much, but it was what I had. I quickly learned that the all season tires on it weren't going to be much fun and bought a set of Kumho tires and a new set of wheels.

I was hooked, and have autocrossed pretty heavily (and sometimes lightly) over the past 24 years.

This blog is a culmination of a number of projects. Long ago I ran a website that started out as Pylon.cc, and then turned into SOLO2.ORG. While that site isn't around,it was the start of my blogging in the autocross world.

Over the years I've raced a number of cars, and blogged about many of them. Currently this site is a collection of posts that used to exist on Project350z.com, Project240z.com and SpecFRS.com. I've consolidated them all here, and will be adding new content going forward.
