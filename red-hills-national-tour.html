												>Last Thursday I wrote a blog post about the trip down
												to Moultrie Georgia for the 2024 Red Hills Solo National
												Tour</a
											>, this post will serve as the event review from the
											event. My first National Tour event in a number of years.
										</p>

										<p>
											We arrived in Moultrie late Thursday night and got checked
											in to our hotel. The lot was exceptionally small, so
											getting the truck and trailer situated took Dave some
											work, but fortunately being a Thursday night there weren’t
											many customer vehicles on the lot, so we had plenty of
											room for the rig.
										</p>

										<p>
											The event was held at Spence Field just outside of
											Moultrie. Probably 30-40 miles from the South Georgia
											Motorsports Park where previous tours have been held (and
											attended by myself). Spence Field is an old WWII air field
											that was used for advanced pilot training. Since the war
											it has served a number of purposes, it’s most prominent
											use being host of one of the largest Agriculture expos
											held every fall. Driving into the property feels very
											familiar to those initiated in autocross and old air
											fields, similar to Walnut Ridge, Lincoln and many other
											autocross sites that I’ve visited over the years.
										</p>

										<p>
											Friday we pretty much woke up to wetness in Georgia. It
											rained off and on throughout the day. This made the idea
											of the practice course not all that interesting, but I
											knew I needed to get out there anyways. I ended up taking
											3 runs. The first run I spun. The second run was okay. The
											third run I spun and saw the Mustang sliding into a light
											pole… No more practice runs for me, blood pressure too
											high after that scare.
										</p>

										<p>
											Friday evening I went out for 2 course walks. By this time
											my feet were thoroughly soaked, and I managed to give
											myself a nice big ole blister on my big toe on the right
											foot which then bothered me for the rest of the weekend.
											Reminder: Put some damn waterproof shoes in my autocross
											box.
										</p>

										<p>
											Saturday morning we got up, had breakfast at the hotel,
											their continental breakfast left a little to be desired,
											but they did have some decent sausage biscuits that you
											could get and heat up. From there a quick stop at the gas
											station to grab a coffee and supplies for the day before
											heading out to the event site, waiting for the sun to come
											up.
										</p>

										<p>
											Another couple of course walks really set my blistered
											feet on fire for the day. Second Reminder: Waterproof
											shoes, dry socks.
										</p>

										<p>
											My work assignment for the weekend was to be Sweep for the
											second heat. For the uninitiated, sweep is the car that
											goes out half way though each run (3 runs per heat, 6
											sweep runs) to grab the paper corner sheets in which a
											corner worker writes down every car that goes passed, and
											which cones (if any) that car hit. This is something done
											at National Events, and sweep brings the sheets in so that
											if a driver has a question they can look at the corner
											sheets to see which specific cone they hit on a previous
											run. Super helpful when you aren’t sure if/where you hit a
											cone. This was my first time doing sweep, in 24 years, I
											had Evan Williams riding along with me as the worker
											chief, he actually did most of the work, grabbing and
											organizing the papers, I just did the driving.
										</p>

										<p>
											By the time the third heat came around I was ready to go.
											I had setup two GoPros on the top of the car, but was
											unable to get them working properly with the remote, I
											figured out the new Hero12 was setup to shut off after 5
											minutes of inactivity, which meant I needed to keep
											changing the mode every so often or it would shut off, so
											I missed the forward facing video of my first run, and the
											SoloStorm error’d out connecting to the Hero4 that Dave
											uses with that setup. I did however manage to get a rear
											facing video of that run. The run started out exciting, I
											looped the car right after the start line and put the nose
											off into the grass. No harm no foul. I ended up with a
											time of something like 58 seconds, which I figured was 10+
											seconds off from where I should have been on the first
											run.
										</p>

										<p>
											Second run was much better, good enough for second place,
											about .5 behind Dave’s best run which would come on his
											third run. My third run however, was wet. How so? Somehow
											it started raining as I got into the car for my third run,
											and then pulling up to the line and starting it started
											raining harder, enough to make the ground slick and cause
											me to be about 2 seconds slower than my second run. Still
											good enough for second, but not near as close to Dave as I
											would need to be for Sunday.
										</p>

										<p>
											Saturday evening the local region provided Pizzas for
											dinner, I am NOT a fan of cold pizza, so I was right near
											the front of the line and was pleasantly surprised that I
											enjoyed the Marcos deliver they brought in. Kudos to the
											Red Hills region for a great dinner experience!
										</p>

										<p>
											Dave, Beth and Sean all went out for a course walk after
											dinner, I didn’t dare attempt that on Saturday evening due
											to the pain I was feeling in my feet, I was hoping that I
											would be a bit better Sunday morning and get a couple of
											course walks in before Sunday runs.
										</p>

										<p>
											Fortunately my feet did feel a tad better for those Sunday
											course walks, I managed to get 2 walks in before first
											heat. My feet definitely paid the price, but I was glad to
											see the course in Sunday’s direction, which was reverse of
											the course from Saturday with a few minor changes at the
											start and finish lines to configure for reverse running.
										</p>

										<p>
											Sunday competition runs definitely started out better, my
											first run I was about a tenth of a second faster than
											Dave, second run was even faster for me, but I managed to
											hit a cone entering the final turnaround. I wasn’t sure
											where I had hit the cone, so I ran over to the area where
											they kept the corner sheets to try to track down what I
											hit. On Dave’s second run he was a tenth of a second
											faster than my dirty run was at 44.589+1.
										</p>

										<p>
											I knew I needed to put a good clean, fast, run down on my
											third run, so I went out and did what I could. Putting in
											a 44.099, not quite the 43 I was looking for, and not
											enough to catch Dave for the lead in CAM-C. Dave went out
											on his third run and put a 44.155 down, giving him an
											overall victory of .486. Here’s a video of both of our
											third runs from Sunday.
										</p>

											referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
											allowfullscreen=""
										></iframe>

										<p>
											Promptly after third runs were done I started packing
											things up for the trip home. Dave and Beth planned to make
											the drive over 2 days, getting home later on Monday, so I
											hopped in with Sean and Melissa to make the full drive
											home. Big thanks to both of them, and Dave and Beth, for
											putting up with me over the weekend!
										</p>

										<p>
											Overall I was pleased with how I did for my first real
											event in almost a year, and first time driving the Mustang
											since September 2021. I look forward to getting more
											adjusted to the ride and seeing how else the rest of the
											year goes!
										</p>

										<p>
											What’s next? A local event on the 21st of April, then the
											CAM Challenge in St. Charles, MO the first weekend of May.
