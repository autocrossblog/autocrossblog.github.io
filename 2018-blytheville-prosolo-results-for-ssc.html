										</p>

										<p>In short, WOW. What an amazing weekend.</p>

										<p>
											I went into the weekend hopeful that I would drive the car
											well, and that I would be able to prove to myself that I
											can hang with the big dogs. I’ve been autocrossing for a
											long time (with a few gaps in between) and while I’ve had
											some spurts of random success outside of St. Louis, I have
											never felt confident that I could do it repeatedly. The
											idea of SSC, a Spec class in Solo, was very intriguing to
											me, as I wanted to try to rule out “I don’t have the right
											car”, from the equation.
										</p>

										<p>
											The weekend started out with me leaving St. Louis just
											after 1pm due to a company all hands meeting. I ended up
											getting down to Arkansas Aeroplex in Blytheville just
											after 5pm on Friday evening. I parked the car and met up
											with my co-driver for the weekend, Kevin Dietz out of
											Washington state. We discussed if there was a chance to do
											practice starts, or take a shot at the practice course.
											The practice starts were wrapping up, so I quickly
											unloaded the car and headed over. We ended up taking 7
											practice runs between the two of us, and found the car to
											be rather pushy.
										</p>

										<p>
											At this point we debated what to do to try to correct for
											the pushiness. Kevin thought that we needed to try to fix
											it with alignment as we had already taken out all the
											front shock (set them at full soft). In my packing haste
											on Thursday evening I realized I forgot to pack my toe
											plates and camber gauge. Matt Hodges had set however, so
											we were covered there if we did decide to change the
											alignment. After much debate we decided that we wouldn’t
											change anything until after morning runs on Saturday. We
											went through tech, at which point I said hello to the
											other driver of the car for the weekend, Lori Gill out of
											Topeka Kansas.
										</p>

										<p>
											We got a few course walks in before sunset and then I
											headed off to Wal-Mart for the supplies I needed for a
											weekend of autocross, sunscreen, sandwich meats, drinks,
											ice and even a new cooler. Saturday morning started out
											with breakfast at the Perkins attached to the Holiday Inn,
											which took WAY too darn log for a serving of biscuits and
											gravy, I then headed to the event site and got a few
											course walks in on each side. From there it was time to
											finish the final prep on the car, which included getting a
											few more of the required decals mounted.
										</p>

										<p>
											Lori was the first driver up for the weekend, competing in
											L4, so I took the car over to grid to get her setup and
											ready for the 9am start time. Lori headed out and ran in
											L4 having a good showing for her first time in the car.
											When SSC was up in Group 3, I went out as first driver and
											had a red light on my left side runs. On the right side
											course I ended up with a cone on each run. That put myself
											in I believe 12th place out of 13 for the class. Even with
											that poor placement, I was pretty happy. I had fun driving
											the car, and without the cones and red lights, I was sure
											that I could hold my own in the car in the class if I
											cleaned things up.
										</p>

										<p>
											Kevin went out with the second driver pairings, and
											performed very well. He ended up sitting in the lead in
											SSC after the Saturday morning runs, and didn’t let that
											lead go all weekend. After the morning runs, and the
											performance of the car we decided that we didn’t need to
											make changes to the alignment and would run it as is.
										</p>

										<p>
											Being the leader, Kevin was now gridded at the front of
											the class, and went out on his Saturday afternoon runs and
											improved on his times on both sides by .171. Me, being
											near the bottom of the pack got relegated to the second
											driver line, we decided to try setting the front shocks
											back up a little bit, so I turned them from full soft, 1/2
											turn. I went out and on my first Saturday afternoon left
											side run and turned my two prior red lights into a coned
											run, but at least it was a time. On the right side I was
											able to clean up cones from the first two passes, and on
											my final run on the right side run make up more time. I
											managed to move up into 3rd spot, .056 back from David
											Lousteau, and .256 back from Kevin. Funny story, after my
											second left side run, I immediately headed to impound, I
											was stoked that I finally had a good run on the left and
											completely forgot that I needed to run one more run on the
											right. Lucky for me I was able to get back in line and get
											the right side run completed.
										</p>

										<p>
											Sunday morning Kevin and I both went out with the goal of
											improving things considerable. I was honestly hoping to
											catch him, and he was hoping to put down quick runs on his
											first runs to try and increase his lead on the class. He
											succeeded, I did not. Kevin managed to put his fastest
											times down for the weekend on his final run on each side.
											I managed to do my fastest on Sunday morning as well, but
											not near as fast as I think I could have been. Ultimately
											I finished in third place, a trophy spot, and Kevin took
											the win in the SSC class.
										</p>

										<p>
											Towards the end of the day I was sitting in 44th
											qualifying position for the Super Challenge, the 32 car
											bracket competition at the end of the ProSolo event. I put
											my name into the drawing to get into the 8 car bonus
											challenge, but with all of the people who ended up
											dropping out of the Super Challenge bracket I ended up
											getting in as the 32nd seed. Kevin got in as the 6th seed
											I believe.
										</p>

													alt="Spec FR-S leaving the Line"
											/></a>
										</p>

										<p>
											With the bracket competition, each car lines up and runs
											their Class’ dial in time, which for me, meant in order to
											be fast, I needed to run Kevin’s fastest time for the
											right side, and left side. To account for this, each car
											that lines up in the bracket has a unique pattern to the
											lights at the starting line. For a slower car, such as
											SSC, that means we would typically leave BEFORE the car we
											are lined up against, with the idea being that if we both
											ran perfect times we would cross the finish line at
											exactly the same time. My first time in the Super
											Challenge was not uneventful. I went out on the right side
											course, lined up against the #1 seed, David Whitner. The
											right side course was slightly slower all weekend compared
											to the left side course, so when I came back, with an
											8/10ths of a second difference from David I was pretty
											happy, knowing that I could probably make up that
											difference on the left side.
										</p>

										<p>
											When David and I lined up on the 2nd runs, I was on the
											left. The “christmas tree”, the drag strip lights that
											tell us when to start, started coming down, but they came
											down first for David, and not for me as they should. I
											immediately thought something was wrong, but I couldn’t
											risk sitting there and not taking a run, so I left when my
											lights eventually dropped. That run on the left side was
											sloppy, I was not happy with it, but I was pretty stoked
											when I came in from the run and was told to get right back
											in the lane for the left side and to take another run.
											They had entered the dial in times incorrectly, so they
											needed us to run the course again. On my second time
											around the left course, the car felt MUCH better. Problem
											is, I picked up a cone early on in the process. I still
											pushed to get the car back across the finish with a decent
											time, but I couldn’t make up the deficit of the cone and I
											was bumped from my first Super Challenge attempt in the
											first round.
										</p>

										<p>
											Kevin ended up in the 2nd to last pairing out of the round
											of 32, lined up and defeated Chris Edens in an S2 Miata.
											The next round Kevin lined up against Russell Blume in his
											HS Mini Cooper and took him down as well. The third round
											was SSC #1 and #2 with David Lousteau lining up against
											Kevin. Again Kevin drove away victorious to line up
											against Mike King out of Florida, in his HS Ford. The
											final round had Kevin lined up against Jonathan Warlof in
											a blue Mustang. I can’t do justice with words the
											excitement I had of that final round, so I would encourage
											you to
