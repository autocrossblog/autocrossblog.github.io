				"articleBody": "Hello there, long time no see…. Where has SpecFRS gone? Well here’s the story of how my autocross car came to a very sad demise, and a couple of tips for you on how to not have it happen to yourself.\n\nFirst and foremost: Look into Autocross insurance. Lockton Motorsports provides insurance options that cover cars DURING autocross events, you should definitely check them out. It is very likely that your normal street car insurance policy will NOT cover you, and you asking them if they do may even cause red flags to be raised. I did NOT have autocross insurance on my 2016 Scion FR-S, even though I had looked into it a couple of weeks before the incident, I didn’t pull the trigger (if memory serves, it was like $225 for the year for my car), and would have likely made 2021 not be near as bad as it ended up.\n\nI will not autocross a car again if it doesn’t have autocross insurance, I don’t care who owns the car, lesson (hard) learned.\n\nSo what happened? Well, this incident occurred this summer. I had taken my third run and put down a scorcher, my codriver went out and took his third or fourth run (don’t recall). I was standing next to a buddy of mine trying to watch the run when I saw the car get tail happy, due to where I was standing in grid I couldn’t really see the car/course very well. The car came to a stop and I thought, “oh he just lost control and stopped”. Shortly there after I heard a request for any first responders over the PA, I immediately knew something was wrong. I ran over to where the car was stopped, as I was on my way over I saw a course worker picking something up, I assumed it was a GoPro that had fallen off the car.\n\nIt wasn’t a GoPro, it was the passenger mirror, or parts of it.\n\nWhen I got to the car, my codriver was either out, or getting out of the car. He wasn’t happy, but didn’t appear to be hurt, that was the immediate question to be answered, make sure he was okay.\n\nFrom there we started looking at the car.\n\nThe car had impacted a light pole in the parking lot, scraping down the passenger side of the FR-S. The damage started at the front fender and went all the way back to the quarter panel. The majority of the damage was the passenger door, it was pushed in quit a bit, and didn’t look like it would open. The car would start and drive, so I got in and drove it outside of the course area. The wheel was definitely out of alignment, and had a LOT more play than it should.\n\n\n\nThe side curtain and passenger seat airbags deployed. There was glass everywhere, while the window was down, in the door, it had enough of an impact that the glass from the door and in the mirror, went everywhere. Getting into the car you had to be careful to avoid setting your hand down on something and getting yourself cut up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter parking the car I started trying to assess the situation. We threw a jack under it and removed the right front wheel. The wheel had some damage to it, after removal I found that the tie rod bolt was bent about 45 degrees. At this point I figured there was no way to safely drive the car home, so I began to figure out how to get it home. I called my insurance to get roadside assistance to pick it up, but ultimately a friend was driving through town with an empty trailer and he hauled the car down to Solo Peformance Specialties for me that evening.\n\nLater that week I replaced the tie rod end, that helped bring the wheel back into some version of alignment, but not 100%. I ended up driving the car home to my house from Solo Performance a week or two later and parked it in the garage.\n\nI took the car to two different locations for an estimate, ultimely we choose to go with a facility that friends had had good experiences with. They took the car and ordered a few thousand dollars in parts to try to get it ready to go.\n\nThey ended up digging into the car, cutting the fender and quarter panel off, removed the door, and gave me an updated estimate (we asked them to do that, dig in and let me know if it was going to be more costly than originally expected). Based on the updated estimate, we determined that it just didn’t make sense to repair the car to street car condition. I picked up the car and brought it home in November and it’s been sitting in the garage since, collecting dust. Currently the front and rear bumpers are off the car, along with the lights on the passenger side.\n\nThis spring, hopefully sooner rather than later, I will be stripping the SSC parts off the car and seeing if anyone wants to purchase those. I will also be selling the wheels which have Falken 660 tires on them.\n\nAfter that I will put the OEM suspension back on the car and see how much I can get for it. I really think it would be a good car to start a track/road racer build out of, but I simply don’t have the time or motivation to complete a project like that myself. The motor has ~42k miles on it and was very strong.\n\nEverything but the passenger side of the car was prestine, so who knows what I can actually get for the car. I won’t be parting it out individually at this point, unless I find some car that I think I can easily throw the motor into.\n\nIf you’re looking for a track project car, feel free to reach out to me, let’s see if we can make a deal.\n\n\n\nWhat’s next for me? Well right now I have an order in for a new Nissan Z, and a Ford F-250 truck. I have no idea when either of those will be built….\n\n",

											Hello there, long time no see…. Where has SpecFRS gone?
											Well here’s the story of how my autocross car came to a
											very sad demise, and a couple of tips for you on how to
											not have it happen to yourself.
										</p>

										<p>
											First and foremost: Look into Autocross insurance. Lockton
											Motorsports provides insurance options that cover cars
											DURING autocross events, you should definitely
											<a
												href="https://locktonmotorsports.com/autocross-off-track/"
												>check them out</a
											>. It is very likely that your normal street car insurance
											policy will NOT cover you, and you asking them if they do
											may even cause red flags to be raised. I did NOT have
											autocross insurance on my 2016 Scion FR-S, even though I
											had looked into it a couple of weeks before the incident,
											I didn’t pull the trigger (if memory serves, it was like
											$225 for the year for my car), and would have likely made
											2021 not be near as bad as it ended up.
										</p>

										<h3
											id="i-will-not-autocross-a-car-again-if-it-doesnt-have-autocross-insurance-i-dont-care-who-owns-the-car-lesson-hard-learned"
										>
											I will not autocross a car again if it doesn’t have
											autocross insurance, I don’t care who owns the car, lesson
											(hard) learned.
										</h3>

										<p>
											So what happened? Well, this incident occurred this
											summer. I had taken my third run and put down a scorcher,
											my codriver went out and took his third or fourth run
											(don’t recall). I was standing next to a buddy of mine
											trying to watch the run when I saw the car get tail happy,
											due to where I was standing in grid I couldn’t really see
											the car/course very well. The car came to a stop and I
											thought, “oh he just lost control and stopped”. Shortly
											there after I heard a request for any first responders
											over the PA, I immediately knew something was wrong. I ran
											over to where the car was stopped, as I was on my way over
											I saw a course worker picking something up, I assumed it
											was a GoPro that had fallen off the car.
										</p>

										<p>
											It wasn’t a GoPro, it was the passenger mirror, or parts
											of it.
										</p>

										<p>
											When I got to the car, my codriver was either out, or
											getting out of the car. He wasn’t happy, but didn’t appear
											to be hurt, that was the immediate question to be
											answered, make sure he was okay.
										</p>

										<p>From there we started looking at the car.</p>

										<p>
											The car had impacted a light pole in the parking lot,
											scraping down the passenger side of the FR-S. The damage
											started at the front fender and went all the way back to
											the quarter panel. The majority of the damage was the
											passenger door, it was pushed in quit a bit, and didn’t
											look like it would open. The car would start and drive, so
											I got in and drove it outside of the course area. The
											wheel was definitely out of alignment, and had a LOT more
											play than it should.

											The side curtain and passenger seat airbags deployed.
											There was glass everywhere, while the window was down, in
											the door, it had enough of an impact that the glass from
											the door and in the mirror, went everywhere. Getting into
											the car you had to be careful to avoid setting your hand
											down on something and getting yourself cut up.

										<p>
											After parking the car I started trying to assess the
											situation. We threw a jack under it and removed the right
											front wheel. The wheel had some damage to it, after
											removal I found that the tie rod bolt was bent about 45
											degrees. At this point I figured there was no way to
											safely drive the car home, so I began to figure out how to
											get it home. I called my insurance to get roadside
											assistance to pick it up, but ultimately a friend was
											driving through town with an empty trailer and he hauled
											the car down to Solo Peformance Specialties for me that
											evening.
										</p>

										<p>
											Later that week I replaced the tie rod end, that helped
											bring the wheel back into some version of alignment, but
											not 100%. I ended up driving the car home to my house from
											Solo Performance a week or two later and parked it in the
											garage.
										</p>

										<p>
											I took the car to two different locations for an estimate,
											ultimely we choose to go with a facility that friends had
											had good experiences with. They took the car and ordered a
											few thousand dollars in parts to try to get it ready to
											go.
										</p>

										<p>
											They ended up digging into the car, cutting the fender and
											quarter panel off, removed the door, and gave me an
											updated estimate (we asked them to do that, dig in and let
											me know if it was going to be more costly than originally
											expected). Based on the updated estimate, we determined
											that it just didn’t make sense to repair the car to street
											car condition. I picked up the car and brought it home in
											November and it’s been sitting in the garage since,
											collecting dust. Currently the front and rear bumpers are
											off the car, along with the lights on the passenger side.
										</p>

										<p>
											This spring, hopefully sooner rather than later, I will be
											stripping the SSC parts off the car and seeing if anyone
											wants to purchase those. I will also be selling the wheels
											which have Falken 660 tires on them.
										</p>

										<p>
											After that I will put the OEM suspension back on the car
											and see how much I can get for it. I really think it would
											be a good car to start a track/road racer build out of,
											but I simply don’t have the time or motivation to complete
											a project like that myself. The motor has ~42k miles on it
											and was very strong.
										</p>

										<p>
											Everything but the passenger side of the car was prestine,
											so who knows what I can actually get for the car. I won’t
											be parting it out individually at this point, unless I
											find some car that I think I can easily throw the motor
											into.
										</p>

											If you’re looking for a track project car, feel free to
											reach out to me, let’s see if we can make a deal.
