AutocrossBlog.com is a culmination of two decades of autocrossing and way too many different cars and car websites over the years.

I've tried to consolidate my car blogs into this one location, I am sure there's a broken link or two, but this is a good enough start!

I'll be blogging here going forward for all my automotive autocross adventures. 

For 2024 I'll be back racing in St. Louis and around the Midwest with my good friend Dave Whitworth from [Solo Performance Specialties](https://soloperformance.com/).
