So today I did some testing with UStream and the FM Audio Broadcast at the El Toro ProSolo. I think I managed to come up with a way to broadcast the announce stream out on the internet (audio only) using UStream.

I setup a new â€œChannel" for the ProSolo on Ustream, we'll see how it works out tomorrow, but if you want, give it a listen by going to (only active during competition, and if it works)

(ustream link removed)

This is completely unofficial, and if it goes down it goes down, no promises that it will work! 

Between the live audio and https://sololive.scca.com you might be able to feel like you are actually in El Toro being miles away! The event is supposed to start at 9am, we'll see how things work out.
