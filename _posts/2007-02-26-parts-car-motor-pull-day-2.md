Thanks to Terec for coming over today and helping me [get the motor pulled out of the 78 280Z 2+2 parts car today](/project-240z-day-2-of-parts-car-motor-pull)!

    
Here's what we got done.
    - Pulled the motor and transmission
    - Disconnected the driveshaft
    - Ruined a clutch line (that was all me)
