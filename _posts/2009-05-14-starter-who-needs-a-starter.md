Well it did run for about 10 seconds on Saturday, then I redid the wire for the VR sensor and created some problems. So I redid the wiring tonight, and went to start it.   
Then the starter did this....

It quit engaging so I pulled it out and it fell apart as I was lifting it out of the car. Fortunately this cheap POS is under a lifetime warranty from Autozone, so they are ordering the part in, I'll pick it up when I get back home from the lake trip this weekend. Hopefully I will attempt to start the car again on Sunday.
