Eric and I got a bit done today. Mostly learning with the help of Andy Whittle who stopped by to assist with some Megasquirt questions. I also did some soldering on the Megasquirt wiring, LOTS more soldering to do tomorrow!

The fuel cell is mounted, Eric started on the oil cooler mounting, we ended up figuring out that I did have the correct pieces for that, so all that money isn't wasted.

### Sunday tasks
- Connect Fuel Lines
- Run Megasquirt Wires, Fuses, Relays
- Install Megasquirt
- Install Fuse Panel
- Install Battery (charge battery)
- Install Seats
- Install Radiator
- Connect Starter
- Connect Alternator
- Add Oil to the Motor and Transmission
- Add Coolant
- I'm sure I'll have to add more to this list.
