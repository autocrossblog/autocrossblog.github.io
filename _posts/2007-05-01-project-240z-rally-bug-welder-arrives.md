Mark from The Rally Bug (www.321govideo.com/rallybug) stopped by tonight and dropped off his welder for me to borrow for a week. He was also kind enough to give me some brief lessons as it's been a while (proly 10 years) since I've welded anything!

Thanks Mark for your help tonight, now I can get going on some Major items for the 240z!
