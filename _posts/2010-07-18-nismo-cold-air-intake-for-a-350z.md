So when the Project350z was purchased in Colorado back in January it had a Nismo Cold Air Intake on it. Shortly thereafter I moved to California, and guess what? The Nismo isn't CARB legal, which means it isn't legal for use in the State of California, so off the intake came.

And there it sat. and sat. and sat some more. Until today, I finally decided to pull it out of the box and put it up on Ebay. So there it is, sitting on Ebay, have at it!
