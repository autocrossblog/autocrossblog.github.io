    "body": " Another blog from Chris Hammond. : I started autocross fresh out of college in 2000. I had heard about autox from a fraternity brother as well as from my father who used to do gymkhana events in Missouri in the 60s, but I had never been to or seen an event. I purchased a book about VWs, in it were stories and quotes from the Bob and Patty Tunnel. I joined the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), got the Solo rule book, read it cover to cover, and started attending membership meetings of the St. Louis region. I signed up for the local Novice school, and was hooked. I started autocrossing in a 1994 VW Golf, it wasn’t much, but it was what I had. I quickly learned that the all season tires on it weren’t going to be much fun and bought a set of Kumho tires and a new set of Kosei K1 wheels. I was hooked, and have autocrossed pretty heavily (and sometimes lightly) over the past 24 years. This blog is a culmination of a number of projects including Project240z. com, Project350z. com and SpecFRS. com. Long ago I ran a website that started out as Pylon. cc, and then turned into SOLO2. ORG which for a time was the largest autocross forum on the web. While that site isn’t around anymore, it was the start of my blogging in the autocross world. "

    "body": "2024/10/09 - A month late, it’s time to blog about the 2024 SOlo National Championships… Why did this post take so long? Well immediately after Nationals I got home and continued to work on photos from my RainbowMarks Photography business. It was a good week in Lincoln, I took something like 28k photos and posted a large number of those online for the world to see (and buy). I managed to presell enough photo packages to make the work required to take photos of every individual competing at Nationals (barring those in 5th heats when I was working or running myself) worth it. Overall the photography experience was fun, but a crap ton of work. I likely won’t shoot every car/competitor possible again, but never say never. More on what photos for the 2024 Solo Nationals sometime next summer! So let’s talk about the 2024 Solo Nationals experience, outside of the photo side of things. Preparation for the 2024 Solo Nationals: Prep for this year’s Nationals consisted of me heading to Houston for work a couple of days before I was heading to Lincoln, so mostly Thursday night and Friday I madly scrambled to get everything packed up. The beauty of co-driving with someone like Dave is that you don’t have to bring much with you, he’s got the car/trailer and all the supplies, so really most of my packing was related to camera/photography needs, along with the usual autocross supplies of clothing, sunscreen, helmet and racing shoes. I filled the back of the F250 with tubs full of stuff, as usual, and managed to not use most of it, also as usual. Travelling to Lincoln: Friday morning I hit the road towards Lincoln. I had intended to go the northern route from St. Louis, skipping I-70 in favor of MO-36, basically heading north to Hannibal and then west. The problem was I just went through the motions and turned west on I-70 without thinking about it and made my way towards Kansas City the usual way. The trip was uneventful, no incidents of traffic outside of some construction west of KC, but Waze had me jump off the highway to avoid most of that. I arrived in Lincoln Friday afternoon and was able to get situated with Dave and Beth at the Solo Performance trailer for the week. Saturday’s CAM Invitational: Saturday over on what was partially the pracitce course for the week was the CAM Invitational, an event put together for the CAM and XA/XB Classes to allow for a year end culmination of CAM events. Dave, Beth and I took part in the invitational and shootout. During the invitational portion of the event I performed pretty poorly, finishing 8th in CAMS outside of the trophies with cones on a number of my runs. Dave finished 2nd for that portion of the event. The shootout went a bit better, but I’ll be honest, I can’t exactly remember where I ended up and the results online don’t show anything actually useful in terms of who finished where, but I’m pretty sure I beat Dave, maybe. Museum of Speed: Saturday evening the CAM Competitors were invited to the Museum of Speed from Speedway Motors, which if you’ve never visited is a must see in Lincoln Nebraska. It had been years (12?) since I had stepped through the doors there, I was glad that I did this year and spent some time walking around. Here are some photos I took on my phone at the Museum after the dinner and awards ceremony.                                                                                Tuesday and Wednesday competition at the Solo Nationals: CAM-C ran on Tuesday/Wednesday of the week of Nationals, late in the day. So we had plenty of time to get course walks in. I actually didn’t walk as much this year as I have in the past, I managed 3 walks of our first course on Monday I believe, along with 2 walks early Tuesday morning. Tuesday evening I walked day 2’s course twice and then repeated that again Wednesday morning. Overall with the results I was pleased, I got my 3rd National trophy with a 6th place finish in CAM-C, but I was sitting in 5th after Day 1. Day 2 I managed to only get a clean run on the first run, so I wasn’t able to defend that 5th place spot. Dave ended up in 4th for the event, 2 trophies ahead of me. Here are some videos of our 2024 Solo Nationals runs. Dave West Course Fastest Run 52. 457: Chris West Course Fastest Run 52. 511: Dave East Course Fastest Run 67. 429: Chris East Course Fastest Run 52:457: Thursday and Friday: Running on Tuesday and Wednesday frees us up for Thursday and Friday. I was announcing the 5th heat on Thursday/Friday for my work assignment, so I shot photos most of the day then got myself ready for the runs I was covering. I ended up announcing for FSAEL, GS, STH and a couple of other classes I’m forgetting :D Nothing too eventful happened, but it was great to get to call Evan William’s G Street win! What’s next?: So what’s coming next? Well, the next weekend after Nationals I ran a local event in an AS Z06, that was fun! I am leaning towards running in SSC again in 2025 though, so I will be working on purchasing a new ride for that endeavor hopefully in the next month or two! "

    "title": "10 Things to Prepare for at the 2024 Solo National Championships",
    "body": "2024/08/25 - So you’re heading to your first Solo National Championships, it can be overwhelming, you’ve likely never experienced anything like you’re going to see this week in Lincoln Nebraska, so I’m going to try to take some time to give you a heads up! Hopefully it will help you have an even more fun week! 1. One of the Largest Motorsport Events in the World: The Solo Nationals is one of the largest motorsport events globally, featuring nearly 1,300 competitors over four days. When you combine this with the ProSolo Finale and CAM Challenge beforehand, there will be nearly 7,000 competition runs. It’s a massive event that brings together the best autocross drivers from across the nation, making it an experience like no other. 2. Course Walks Are Important: At Nationals, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to walk the courses. You’ll run two separate courses: the East and West, sometimes referred to as the “plane” and “corn” sides. The courses will be open for walking multiple times throughout the week, starting on Monday when no competition runs are happening. They are open all day Monday from around 10 am and then each morning from Tuesday to Friday before competition starts. Walking the course multiple times helps you familiarize yourself with the layout, visualize your driving lines, and plan your strategy for each run. 3. Social Activities: There are plenty of opportunities for social activities throughout the week of Nationals. Local regions often host cookouts, parties, and other gatherings around the paddock, creating a festive atmosphere. You’ll find everything from big wheel races to margarita machines and beer trades scattered throughout the area. Whether you prefer to stay on-site for the festivities or explore Lincoln’s local scene, there’s no shortage of ways to unwind and connect with fellow competitors and enthusiasts. 4. Getting Around Town in Lincoln: Lincoln, Nebraska, the host city for the Solo Nationals, is a vibrant college town with a variety of restaurants, bars, and local attractions to explore. The city is easy to navigate, with most amenities and popular spots located within a short drive from the event site. However, keep in mind that the Solo Nationals coincide with the University of Nebraska’s football season, and there are games on the weekends that bookend the championship. This can lead to increased traffic and limited parking, especially downtown and near the stadium, so plan your trips accordingly. 5. Length of the Courses: One thing you will likely experience for the first time at Nationals is the length of the courses. These courses are typically over a minute long, which is quite different from the shorter courses most people encounter at local autocross events around the country. The extended length of the courses can be both exciting and challenging, providing more opportunities for mistakes but also allowing drivers to showcase their endurance and consistency. 6. Much Better Competition: The competition at Solo Nationals is often top-notch, bringing together the best drivers from all across the country in every class. This is where you’ll find the elite competitors who excel in their local regions, making the challenge at Nationals significantly tougher. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t come out on top. Nationals is as much about learning and growing as a driver as it is about winning. Use this opportunity to gain experience, connect with fellow competitors, and make new friends. 7. Tire Service and Other Vendors: If you’re coming to Nationals and need tire services such as mounting, balancing, or flipping, be sure to check out SPS and RS Racing, located near the front of the paddock. They provide excellent on-site services to help drivers with their tire needs throughout the event. In addition to tire services, there are several other vendors on site, including food vendors, coffee stands, and booths selling t-shirts and event merchandise. Be sure to visit them multiple times throughout the week to see what they are offering. Supporting them is a great way to contribute to the community and keep the event lively. 8. Paddock: The paddock at Solo Nationals is enormous, and it’s likely unlike any event you’ve attended before in terms of size and the number of competition and support vehicles packed into one spot. The area is meticulously organized into laid-out rows and columns, so it’s important to pay attention to where you are assigned to park. Make sure not to encroach on someone else’s space, as every spot is accounted for. The paddock tends to get extremely crowded on Tuesday and Wednesday when competitors for Thursday and Friday arrive while those who competed earlier in the week may still be there. Be patient, be kind, and help people out. 9. Results and Announcements: Stay connected and informed throughout the event by using the Sportity app, which is an essential tool for the Solo Nationals. This app provides a wealth of useful information, including run time updates, important announcements, and links to results. It’s the best way to stay up to date with what’s happening on and off the course. By regularly checking the app, you’ll ensure that you’re aware of any schedule changes, heat updates, or other critical information. 10. Results and Awards: In the past, results and awards at Solo Nationals were traditionally handed out at banquets on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday nights. However, the format has changed, and now trophies are awarded directly in the grid after the competition ends for the day. It’s important to pay attention to when and where the awards are being given out. Even if you don’t end up taking home a trophy, it’s a great experience to stick around and cheer on your fellow competitors. 5 More Things to Know for Your First Solo Nationals: 11.

And boy am I glad I did, I sucked, I need to get some more reps! View Photos from the Weekend! This weekend was the Grissom National Tour, held just outside of Grissom Air Reserve Base in Bunker Hill, Indiana, where I lived and went to high school for my sophemore year back in the day. I headed up from St. Louis on Friday morning, taking a few work calls along the way and while I was on site. I got there just in time to take a couple of practice runs. The practice course was a good example of what the Saturday course would be. No offense to the course designer, but that course sucked. Such tight turn arounds that left you with very little variation and no flow what so ever. I ended up sitting in 4th on Saturday after the first day of runs, way off the pace of the leaders in CAM-C, including Dave the car owner. I was pretty miserable at the experience. The only bright side of Saturday, okay there were two bright sides: I got to announce for the first time in quite some time, that felt good and I got complements on the effort from a variety of folks. The other bright side was the weather, couldn’t have asked for a better weekend of weather in Mid-August! Here are both Dave and my best runs from Saturday: Chris Hammond Run 3 53. 922 +1: Dave Whitworth Run 3 53. 278: Sunday was a little better, though Dave wasn’t as close to the leader in CAM-C as he was on Saturday, I was happy to be closer to Dave and further up on the Index for the day (somwhere around 35 vs 76 the day before, 51 with both days combined). The course was actually ran in the same direction as Saturday, with a few of the turns modified to not be quite so restrictive, knocking off 5-6 seconds off the times. Here is Dave’s best run from Sunday, GoPro Hero12 mounted on the front of the hood of the Mustang: Dave Whitworth Run 3 47. 585: I ended up in third for the weekend in the CAM-C class, Dave ended up in second.

    "title": "1975 Triumph TR6 Alternator Upgrade and Replacement",
    "body": "2024/07/09 - So now for a little story about the Triumph. The first of potentially many. Another Project car! What Triumph?: What Triumph you might ask? My Dad purchased this car in 1985 when he was stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina. He owned the car up until he passed away in September of 2023. My brother and I have both decided that the car won’t leave the family, so I’ve got it at home in my garage for now, at some point he will likely take it too.  So let’s get into some details. The Triumph has been in decent shape for its whole life, Dad used to spend hours working on it, seeing him do that got me doing the same on my 1973 Super Beetle back in the day. The last time I drove it, either late last year, or early this year, I was taking it from the house to my parent’s storage unit, wanting to get it out of our garage for the winter so that we could get some of our own vehicles in the garage, and at the time I also still had the Corvette in the garage. On my way to the storage facility (one evening, so it was dark or getting dark), it started to act funny, run funny, kicking and choking. I managed to pull into a grocery store parking lot trying to determine what was going on, and ultimately pulled through that lot into a parking lot for the local Library. At that point it died and I couldn’t get it started. I called up a buddy who happened to live within a 1/4 mile of the library and he came over to help tow me to the storage lot, just another mile or so from the library. Before we tried towing it though we threw a little battery jump box that he had onto the car, that allowed me to start the car up and drive it the rest of the way to the storage lot, but as I pulled in to enter the keycode to open the gate, the car died again, draining the jump box. We pushed it down to the storage room and put it away for the winter. I figured either the battery died, or the alternator died, so I would need to check those out and replace one or both come spring time. Time to get the Triumph home: I started by getting back over to the storage unit and grabbing the battery out of the car. Took it home, charged it. Then took it to Autozone to have it tested. Battery tested okay. So that left me with the idea that the alternator must be shot. One afternoon I called my buddy who helped me get the car back to storage, he shuttled me to the storage unit and then followed me home as I drove it back home on the fully charged battery. No issues getting home running on just the battery, but it was done during the day so the headlights weren’t on. With the car home I decided it was time to order an alternator, first looking at Moss Motor’s website to see what they had in terms of an Alternator for a 1975 Triumph TR6. They had a rebuilt unit, available for cars with an air pump, for $450, quite pricey (I didn’t realize at the time that included the refundable $200 core charge). I thought there might be a better option so I searched around, initially at local autoparts stores and online, but I simply couldn’t find an alternator that would work. After searching for a bit I started stumbling on some threads in old british car forums suggesting that you could swap out a 75 alternator with one off of a 78-80 Ford Fiesta.  From reading, it appeared that it should simply be a drop in replacement without modification to wiring, so I figured I would go that route, a benefit of the change would be improved amperage of the Fiesta alternator as well. I ordered a unit from RockAuto, part number 13107N. Upon receipt I realized it wouldn’t quite be as drop in friendly as I had hoped. When I tried to mount it to the side of the engine I realized that the holes wouldn’t align to allow me to mount it and use the tensioner that was used on the previous Lucas alternator.  Getting Help for the Triumph Alternator: Reaching out to Dave at Solo Performance Specialties for some advice (he’s my go to for all advice) I learned that you can “clock” an alternator, which basically involves taking the shell apart and rotating it to get the right location for mounting into the car. Clocking an alternator seemed pretty straightforward, undo three sets of nuts and bolts, remove the cover, rotate the cover (120 degrees so that the flange lines up) to the right position, and then put it back together. And it went just as simple as that. I had it apart and back together in under 15 minutes, but as I was done and getting up from where I had been working on the alternator I came across a small piece of what looked like a magnet on the floor. I thought “oh damn, I broke something”. So I took the alternator back part and started looking for broken bits inside to see if I broke something. After looking it over, it sure looked like things were in their appropriate location, so I put the alternator back together and got to putting it back into the car.  Upon putting the alternator back in the car I figured out my next problem. With clocking it, the hole in the flange where the bolt would go through was no longer big enough for the previously used mounting bolt. That was an easy fix though, I grabbed a 5/16” drill bit and a hand drill and opened it up a bit to make everything fit. From there it was a matter of plugging in the wires, putting the belt on the pulley and starting up the car. Ignition bulb powers alternator?: Oh I forgot to mention, while I was looking around for info about clocking the alternator I came across some forum threads that talked about an Ignition light/lamp on the dash of the TR6 that should light up when you turn the key on, and go out when the car is running and the alternator has engaged and is charging. I also read that if the bulb in that lamp goes out, the alternator won’t charge the battery. What? Yeah, you read that right. If the ignition light bulb on a Triumph TR6 is burnt out, the alternator will not work and charge the battery. So this led me down the path of trying to see if that bulb worked. When I turned the key on, it didn’t appear to light up, so I reached up into the dash to see if I could access it, it easily came out of the back of the dash. Basically the whole socket pulled out, easily removable from within the gauge cluster. I pulled the bulb out and took it with me to a parts store. I tried Napa, the guy there figured out the part number, but unfortunately didn’t have a replacement bulb in stock, part number 1449. I drove 30 minutes to a Carquest whose inventory showed in stock online, only to be told they couldn’t find them. A quick search on Amazon and order placed would get me a new bulb the following day. Sunady morning I waited around for the delivery of the bulbs from Amazon, upon receipt I put it into the sock and turn the key on, no dice, the bulb won’t turn on. I look at the box and realize I actually ordered bulb 1446, not 1449. Another Amazon order placed and a few days later I had the proper 1449 bulbs in hand. Once again, put the bulb in the socket, turn the key, and nothing. WTF. Long story short, apparently the bulb isn’t grounded, and won’t light up just hanging below the dash. I eventually put it back into the gauge cluster and turned the key, and what do you know, the ignition light came on. Now on to starting the car and seeing if the alternator worked. Nope…. . The bulb would turn on, the car would start, but the bulb would never go out. As I understand it, the way the alternator works is it needs a 12v signal to “start” up, while the belts running and it receives that signal, once it is up and charging, it grounds that signal and the ignition light goes out. (I’m not an electrician, if any of that is wrong, apologies) No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get the bulb to go out, and I couldn’t get the battery to charge from the alternator. I started testing out the voltage at the battery, on the back of the alternator, elsewhere, and nothing showed me any juice coming form the alternator more than the battery voltage, this told me that the alternator wasn’t sending power to the battery and thus wasn’t charging. Getting the Alternators tested: I ended up taking the original Lucas alternator (FYI, I don’t think it’s the original 1975 alternator, but likely one my father had put in at some point), to Autozone to get tested. The guy running the testing bench struggled quite a bit and never couldn’t quite get the machine working 100%, but at one point it did flash a “failed” message on the screen before quickly going off to some other screen that said it needed something else done. A couple of days later I brought the “New” alternator in as well, to see what it would test at. As I walked in the guy behind the counter (a different guy) asked “Didn’t you just bring that in the other day to test?”, to which I replied yes and no. This was a different alternator. He ended up getting it setup on the bench and testing it out. Sure enough, it also failed. On the autozone testing bench it was not showing as good, and thus not producing power. At this point he basically promised me he could get me an alternator, so I said go for it, I checked and your website said you couldn’t. A few minutes later he was defeated and I was on my way home, needing another alternator. Ordering a second alternator: So off to RockAuto I went, ordering ANOTHER 13107N alternator for a 78-80 Ford Fiesta. I think I ordered it on Friday, had a predicted delivery date of Monday, but was delivered Sunday morning. After washing and cleaning one of the cars Sunday morning I got to work on the Triumph again. I seriously considered taking the new alternator to Autozone to test it out BEFORE I did anything to it, but went ahead and began the process of clocking it. This time however, things went differently. When I pulled it apart I immediately noticed two pieces down inside that stuck out and ultimately blocked the shaft of the alternator from being reinserted. They looked awfully familiar, just like the broken piece of randomness I found after clocking the other new alternator. What I figured out was that I had apparently broken those bits off in the first new alternator, though I only found one piece, not two from that one.  Anyways, this time around I made sure not to break those off, I think they are brushes, they ultimately are part of the voltage regulator and press up against part of the copper shaft when the alternator is spinning. I ended up having to take the voltage regulator off the back of the case, tie a string around those two spring loaded brushes to push them back into their position and hold them in place. I then reinserted the voltage regulator, finished clocking the body and then cut/removed the string. This allowed the brushes so go back in place. From there the process was really straightforward, reinstall the alternator, plug things in and see how it went. Success As soon as I put the new alternator in, hooked up the wires and the belt, I started the car. The ignition light was on, and then fairly quickly went off. A quick check of the back of the alternator with a multimeter also showed a higher voltage coming from the alternator than the battery was sending! A couple of last items for anyone who stumbles on this post when working on their 1975 Triumph TR6 alternator. The alternator actually has 3 wires, though you’ll see above in the pictures that I only have two hooked up, and I only had 2 hooked up on the lucas alternator that I pulled out. The third wire is another 12V, I believe that third wire was used on the OEM alternator, but on newer units it isn’t required. The wire was just sitting free in the engine bay as seen in the photo below. I will tie it off to keep it safely not connected to anything.  Extra alternators?: So now I have a couple of alternators sitting around the garage. I figure if I can order a new voltage regulator I can repair the 13107N that hasn’t been used. I’ll also hold on to the Lucas unit in case I need to CORE that at some point. Now that the car is running again I need to get it inspected so I can get plates on it and drive it around town!

    "title": "Recap of the 2024 St. Louis CAM Challenge Autocross",
    "body": "2024/05/08 - Last week, the thrill of autocross took over the Family Arena in St. Charles, Missouri, with the 2024 St. Louis CAM Challenge event. Competitors in various classes including CAM (Classic American Muscle) and others like XA/XB and Club Spec battled it out on the asphalt for top honors in both class competition and the challenge rounds. How the CAM Challenge Works: The CAM Challenge follows a structured format:  Saturday Morning &amp; Afternoon Runs: Each car in classes like CAM-C, where I competed, gets 3 attempts in the morning. Due to time constraints and weather issues onsite, the afternoon runs were reduced to just 2 attempts per driver. The best times from these runs are combined for the class competition.  Sunday Qualifying &amp; Challenge Rounds: Another set of 3 runs on Sunday morning determines who makes it to the challenge rounds in the afternoon, with the top performers moving forward. My Experience in CAM-C: Driving the Solo Performance Specialties 2012 Mustang GT, I started strong. Despite a cone penalty which invalidated my potentially leading run of 42. 178 seconds on Saturday morning, I finished in 5th place with a clean 42. 938 seconds. The afternoon session showed significant improvement, despite being shortened. I clinched a 4th place finish in class with a clean run of 41. 832 seconds, overcoming previous cone penalties and positioning myself well for Sundayâ€™s challenge.  Sunday’s Strategic Runs: Qualifying on Sunday was crucial. I led with a 41. 831 on my first run and opted out of a third run after a slightly slower second attempt, saving the wear on our Bridgestone tires. This decision paid off, securing my place in the top 16 without additional risk.  Challenge Rounds: The Fight for the Top Spots: In the elimination rounds, efficiency was key. I managed a 41. 914 in the first round, advancing without taking a second run. The format shifted in subsequent rounds, with each driver getting only one chance to make their mark. In the second round, I clocked a time of 41. 434, which was not as fast as I hoped, but it was enough to move me into the final round. Dave, Mike Leeder, and John Ward also advanced with impressive times.  The High-Stakes Final Round: The final was intense. An error in the first right-hand turn after the slalom led to a cone strike and a critical decision to ease off to preserve the tires for Dave’s run. Although I finished the course leisurely, ensuring no additional strain on the car, the final round did not go as planned, and I did not actually complete the course correctly, which should have resulted in a DNF, but it was not called in.  Top Performers: In the CAM-C Challenge, Mike Leeder took the top spot, followed by Dave Whitworth and John Ward. On the ladies’ side, remarkable performances were seen from Beth Whitworth and Cindy Duncan in the CAM-Ladies challenge, with Beth taking her first challenge win in an inspiring display of skill and determination. Conclusion: The 2024 CAM Challenge in St. Louis was a memorable event filled with competitive spirit, strategic driving, and communal support among autocross enthusiasts. Congratulations to all participants, especially to those who reached new personal bests and to Beth for her outstanding achievement. Event Photos: I have posted all the photos I’ve published from the event over on SmugMug, you can purchase prints or digital downloads there. Unfortunately I was only able to shoot Heats 2 and 3 due to running in Heat 1.

    "title": "From Cones to Camaraderie: Recap of St. Louis's First Autocross of 2024",
    "body": "2024/04/22 - The first local autocross of the year was officially Event #2 for the St. Louis Region SCCA. Why Event #2 if it was the first? Event #1 ended up getting scrapped due to lot availability issues and the committee just left the original titles of the events the same. I am not sure when I last ran a regional event; it was likely back in 2022 when I drove Matt Miller’s Camaro at Gateway, where the car nearly caused a serious accident by heading straight for some jersey barriers and a fence. Event Overview: Showing up to the event in the morning, I knew what to expect, I’ve run locally in St. Louis since 2000, so things shouldn’t be that much different. The event had 155 drivers pre-registered, so coming into the day you have to assume a few things, being the first event. 1) There will be delays2) There will be newbies getting lost3) You will be there longer than you want to be4) You will have fun Overall the event ran pretty smoothly, a few timing issues, many of which I think were caused by workers running through the finish. Things will smooth out as people get the rust off, and newbies start to learn how things work. ProTip: If you’re working in the timing van, and you see someone run through the finish lights, essentially tripping a finish when a car hasn’t ran through the lights, there’s a button on the timer called “Reset Finish”, if you’re fast enough, you can hit that button BEFORE the next car comes through the finish and you’ll save yourself, and everyone else, a lot of headache with timing issues. If you aren’t able to do this quickly, don’t fret; it takes time to get comfortable with some of these tools. The People: It was great to catch up with folks I haven’t seen in a few years! Thanks to everyone who said hello to me. I thought about trying to list off all the folks I hadn’t seen in a while, but I am positive I would forget someone and I don’t want to do that, so, no names, but it was great to see you all! Working the Course: I ended up working at Corner 4 in the first heat. I haven’t ran that much in quite a while and am paying for that with full on body pains today! This corner was the Chicago box followed by a non-optional 3 cone slalom before the finish. The first couple of runs people didn’t hit too many cones, but as they started pushing, all the cones in the Chicago box and the slalom started to suffer. One guy came out while we were working and scolded us for not seeing that a cone was out of position in the slalom. ProTip: Just call this out over the radio so that course workers can be informed and fix it, no need to walk out on the course yourself to do something to the course. To be honest, that’s probably grounds for disqualification… The Course: Ouch, let me start off by saying, I have never turned so much at an autocross on the family arena parking lot as I did on the course yesterday. I am not sure I would define this as fun in a 2012 Mustang. We were the fastest car on the course? Certainly! Could it have been a more enjoyable experience? Absofrickenlutely. The Results: Dave and I ran second heat in CAM-C. I started out running a time of 55. * with a cone, which based on the times I had noticed while working the course seemed to be a decent starting point. My second run I managed to drop a second off to get down to a 54. 3* while Dave put down a 55. 4* on his second run. Third run I managed to get to a 54. 333 which would end up being my fastest, while Dave put down a 54. 5. Fourth runs we both put down slower times, and then on our fifth and final runs we each put down a 54. 1*, with Dave running a 54. 162 to my 54. 105, the catch being that I had a cone on my 5th run to negate the improvement and give Dave the win again for the weekend. I am never really happy when I don’t finish on top of PAX results, it’s been a while since that has occurred, but I look forward to hopefully achieving that goal a few times in 2024… The Photos: Because I was working first heat, running second heat, I was only able to shoot photos of the third heat, but I managed to take 1300 photos during that time. I have posted 300 of those photos on my RainbowMarks Photography event gallery, check it out and purchase a shot or two if you ran third! If you ran first or second heat, sorry! Hopefully at some point this year I’ll get an opportunity to take pictures of every driver. (Perhaps at the CAM Challenge in two weeks!)           What’s next?: The CAM Challenge is coming up here in less than two weeks, once again at the Family Arena in St. Charles, MO. If you haven’t signed up yet, get signed up! Local entrants not running in CAM classes (or the X classes) can run for $45 for the weekend, with 6 runs on Saturday and 3 runs on Sunday! CAM/X drivers can enter for $125 entry with the same 9 runs but also the ability to qualify for the Challenge portion after the Sunday morning runs. If you’ve not run a SCCA National level event before, this is the perfect time to try it out. You’ll see drivers that are way faster than what you’ll find at typical location regional event, and if you’re local to STL you get to do it without all the travel costs! Sign Up Today! Videos of Runs: Here is the video of my fastest autocross run, followed by Dave’s fastest run from Sunday April 21st, 2024 "

    "title": "Red Hills National Tour Results",
    "body": "2024/03/30 - Last Thursday I wrote a blog post about the trip down to Moultrie Georgia for the 2024 Red Hills Solo National Tour, this post will serve as the event review from the event. My first National Tour event in a number of years. We arrived in Moultrie late Thursday night and got checked in to our hotel. The lot was exceptionally small, so getting the truck and trailer situated took Dave some work, but fortunately being a Thursday night there weren’t many customer vehicles on the lot, so we had plenty of room for the rig. The event was held at Spence Field just outside of Moultrie. Probably 30-40 miles from the South Georgia Motorsports Park where previous tours have been held (and attended by myself). Spence Field is an old WWII air field that was used for advanced pilot training. Since the war it has served a number of purposes, it’s most prominent use being host of one of the largest Agriculture expos held every fall. Driving into the property feels very familiar to those initiated in autocross and old air fields, similar to Walnut Ridge, Lincoln and many other autocross sites that I’ve visited over the years. Friday we pretty much woke up to wetness in Georgia. It rained off and on throughout the day. This made the idea of the practice course not all that interesting, but I knew I needed to get out there anyways. I ended up taking 3 runs. The first run I spun. The second run was okay. The third run I spun and saw the Mustang sliding into a light pole… No more practice runs for me, blood pressure too high after that scare. Friday evening I went out for 2 course walks. By this time my feet were thoroughly soaked, and I managed to give myself a nice big ole blister on my big toe on the right foot which then bothered me for the rest of the weekend. Reminder: Put some damn waterproof shoes in my autocross box. Saturday morning we got up, had breakfast at the hotel, their continental breakfast left a little to be desired, but they did have some decent sausage biscuits that you could get and heat up. From there a quick stop at the gas station to grab a coffee and supplies for the day before heading out to the event site, waiting for the sun to come up. Another couple of course walks really set my blistered feet on fire for the day. Second Reminder: Waterproof shoes, dry socks. My work assignment for the weekend was to be Sweep for the second heat. For the uninitiated, sweep is the car that goes out half way though each run (3 runs per heat, 6 sweep runs) to grab the paper corner sheets in which a corner worker writes down every car that goes passed, and which cones (if any) that car hit. This is something done at National Events, and sweep brings the sheets in so that if a driver has a question they can look at the corner sheets to see which specific cone they hit on a previous run. Super helpful when you aren’t sure if/where you hit a cone. This was my first time doing sweep, in 24 years, I had Evan Williams riding along with me as the worker chief, he actually did most of the work, grabbing and organizing the papers, I just did the driving. By the time the third heat came around I was ready to go. I had setup two GoPros on the top of the car, but was unable to get them working properly with the remote, I figured out the new Hero12 was setup to shut off after 5 minutes of inactivity, which meant I needed to keep changing the mode every so often or it would shut off, so I missed the forward facing video of my first run, and the SoloStorm error’d out connecting to the Hero4 that Dave uses with that setup. I did however manage to get a rear facing video of that run. The run started out exciting, I looped the car right after the start line and put the nose off into the grass. No harm no foul. I ended up with a time of something like 58 seconds, which I figured was 10+ seconds off from where I should have been on the first run. Saturday Run 1: Second run was much better, good enough for second place, about . 5 behind Dave’s best run which would come on his third run. My third run however, was wet. How so? Somehow it started raining as I got into the car for my third run, and then pulling up to the line and starting it started raining harder, enough to make the ground slick and cause me to be about 2 seconds slower than my second run. Still good enough for second, but not near as close to Dave as I would need to be for Sunday. Saturday Run 2: Saturday evening the local region provided Pizzas for dinner, I am NOT a fan of cold pizza, so I was right near the front of the line and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the Marcos deliver they brought in. Kudos to the Red Hills region for a great dinner experience! Dave, Beth and Sean all went out for a course walk after dinner, I didn’t dare attempt that on Saturday evening due to the pain I was feeling in my feet, I was hoping that I would be a bit better Sunday morning and get a couple of course walks in before Sunday runs. Fortunately my feet did feel a tad better for those Sunday course walks, I managed to get 2 walks in before first heat. My feet definitely paid the price, but I was glad to see the course in Sunday’s direction, which was reverse of the course from Saturday with a few minor changes at the start and finish lines to configure for reverse running. Sunday competition runs definitely started out better, my first run I was about a tenth of a second faster than Dave, second run was even faster for me, but I managed to hit a cone entering the final turnaround. I wasn’t sure where I had hit the cone, so I ran over to the area where they kept the corner sheets to try to track down what I hit. On Dave’s second run he was a tenth of a second faster than my dirty run was at 44. 589+1. I knew I needed to put a good clean, fast, run down on my third run, so I went out and did what I could. Putting in a 44. 099, not quite the 43 I was looking for, and not enough to catch Dave for the lead in CAM-C. Dave went out on his third run and put a 44. 155 down, giving him an overall victory of . 486. Here’s a video of both of our third runs from Sunday. Promptly after third runs were done I started packing things up for the trip home. Dave and Beth planned to make the drive over 2 days, getting home later on Monday, so I hopped in with Sean and Melissa to make the full drive home. Big thanks to both of them, and Dave and Beth, for putting up with me over the weekend! Overall I was pleased with how I did for my first real event in almost a year, and first time driving the Mustang since September 2021. I look forward to getting more adjusted to the ride and seeing how else the rest of the year goes! "

I met Dave and Beth at Solo Performance this morning and we hit the road just after 7am, with the plan of getting all the way to Moultrie today, Thursday the 21st. This will be my first time to Moultrie, after having run a few times when the National Tour events were held in Adel, GA. All three of us will be driving their 2012 Mustang GT in CAM-C this weekend. I’ve driven this car many times throughout the years, the last time being at Nationals in 2021. It is the car I got my first trophy at Nationals (5th place), back in 2013 when RTR was a thing (street tire index class before 200 treadware street tire were the rules for Street/Stock classes). This will be my first National Tour out of town in a while, I am having trouble remembering exactly when, probably 2019? I attended some ProSolo events in that time, but can’t think of a Tour that I attended since probably Spring Nationals 2019. I am looking forward to running the SPS Mustang in CAM-C this season at as many local and out of town events that I can make work. Scheduling around kids events these days has become more difficult as the kids get older, I am looking forward to them being able to join me at Autocross starting in the next couple of years. Stay tuned for more updates from Moultrie this weekend and look for some links to photos from the event, assuming I get time to take pictures when not running or working. -Chris "

You could stick around after the event, and if you qualified, you would get a trophy to take home. When I started autocrossing, this was my motivation. I wanted to earn a trophy every time I competed. It has been years since I’ve seen that happen locally, I would guess it has probably been since the middle of the aught’s that the region gave out trophied after an event. The trophies varied each year, here are some of the ones I can remember, and you can see some photos of some of them that I still have, 20+ years later. Foam Cones, these were some of the best, kids loved them, they were light, easy to transport, and wouldn’t break! Picture Frames with printed place and event information (done for each event). Glass cups, coffee mugs, pint glasses, you name it. These I still have the most of. Have I used them? Nope, have I tossed them out? No way! The logistics of these had to be a nightmare, they were not setup per event, but definitely per placement (1,2,3), and the weight of hauling these around event to event was probably not fun. One season had some form of stickers that you could get for trophies.  Now, year end trophies, that’s where it is really at. In the past some of the coolest ones I received were:  Embroidered helmet bag Embroidered gear bagNational event trophies are a whole topic of their own for another day.

If you’re selling a project, be sure to let me know! 240z@christoc. com The 1973 Datsun 240Z, also known as the Nissan Fairlady Z in Japan, is a classic sports car that gained popularity for its sleek design, impressive performance, and affordability. Here is a summary of the car’s history, design, and production details: History:: The Datsun 240Z was first introduced in 1969 as a 1970 model, marking the beginning of a line of successful sports cars from Datsun, a subsidiary of Nissan. It was designed to appeal to the American market and was influenced by European sports cars of the era. The 240Z quickly gained a reputation for its powerful performance, striking looks, and accessible price point. Design:: The 240Z showcased a timeless design that combined elements of a classic sports car with a touch of Japanese styling. Its long hood, short rear deck, and low-slung profile gave it a dynamic and aerodynamic appearance. The sleek body featured flowing lines, a prominent grille, and rounded headlights. The interior provided a driver-focused cockpit with comfortable seating, intuitive controls, and sufficient legroom. Engine and Performance:: Under the hood, the 1973 240Z featured a 2. 4-liter inline-six engine, hence the name 240Z, delivering around 151 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. This engine was known for its smooth power delivery and responsiveness. It was paired with a four-speed manual transmission or an optional three-speed automatic. The 240Z boasted impressive acceleration, excellent handling, and a top speed of around 125 mph (201 km/h), making it a thrilling driving experience. Production Numbers:: During its production run from 1970 to 1973, Datsun manufactured a total of 30,938 240Z cars for the U. S. market. These numbers include all model years, so it is difficult to pinpoint the exact production figures for the 1973 model alone. However, the 240Z’s overall popularity and high demand contributed to its significant production numbers, making it a successful and iconic sports car of its time. The 1973 Datsun 240Z remains highly regarded by enthusiasts and collectors today for its timeless design, engaging driving experience, and historical significance as one of the pioneers of Japanese sports cars.

    "body": "2023/01/24 - Autocross is an exciting and challenging motorsport that is quickly gaining popularity among car enthusiasts. It is a competitive event where drivers navigate a course that is laid out on a large parking lot or closed-off airfield. The objective is to complete the course in the fastest time possible, while navigating tight turns, hairpin bends, and other obstacles.

Well here’s the story of how my autocross car came to a very sad demise, and a couple of tips for you on how to not have it happen to yourself. First and foremost: Look into Autocross insurance. Lockton Motorsports provides insurance options that cover cars DURING autocross events, you should definitely check them out. It is very likely that your normal street car insurance policy will NOT cover you, and you asking them if they do may even cause red flags to be raised. I did NOT have autocross insurance on my 2016 Scion FR-S, even though I had looked into it a couple of weeks before the incident, I didn’t pull the trigger (if memory serves, it was like $225 for the year for my car), and would have likely made 2021 not be near as bad as it ended up. I will not autocross a car again if it doesn’t have autocross insurance, I don’t care who owns the car, lesson (hard) learned. : So what happened? Well, this incident occurred this summer. I had taken my third run and put down a scorcher, my codriver went out and took his third or fourth run (don’t recall). I was standing next to a buddy of mine trying to watch the run when I saw the car get tail happy, due to where I was standing in grid I couldn’t really see the car/course very well. The car came to a stop and I thought, “oh he just lost control and stopped”. Shortly there after I heard a request for any first responders over the PA, I immediately knew something was wrong. I ran over to where the car was stopped, as I was on my way over I saw a course worker picking something up, I assumed it was a GoPro that had fallen off the car. It wasn’t a GoPro, it was the passenger mirror, or parts of it. When I got to the car, my codriver was either out, or getting out of the car. He wasn’t happy, but didn’t appear to be hurt, that was the immediate question to be answered, make sure he was okay. From there we started looking at the car. The car had impacted a light pole in the parking lot, scraping down the passenger side of the FR-S. The damage started at the front fender and went all the way back to the quarter panel. The majority of the damage was the passenger door, it was pushed in quit a bit, and didn’t look like it would open. The car would start and drive, so I got in and drove it outside of the course area. The wheel was definitely out of alignment, and had a LOT more play than it should.  The side curtain and passenger seat airbags deployed. There was glass everywhere, while the window was down, in the door, it had enough of an impact that the glass from the door and in the mirror, went everywhere. Getting into the car you had to be careful to avoid setting your hand down on something and getting yourself cut up.  After parking the car I started trying to assess the situation. We threw a jack under it and removed the right front wheel. The wheel had some damage to it, after removal I found that the tie rod bolt was bent about 45 degrees. At this point I figured there was no way to safely drive the car home, so I began to figure out how to get it home. I called my insurance to get roadside assistance to pick it up, but ultimately a friend was driving through town with an empty trailer and he hauled the car down to Solo Peformance Specialties for me that evening. Later that week I replaced the tie rod end, that helped bring the wheel back into some version of alignment, but not 100%. I ended up driving the car home to my house from Solo Performance a week or two later and parked it in the garage. I took the car to two different locations for an estimate, ultimely we choose to go with a facility that friends had had good experiences with. They took the car and ordered a few thousand dollars in parts to try to get it ready to go. They ended up digging into the car, cutting the fender and quarter panel off, removed the door, and gave me an updated estimate (we asked them to do that, dig in and let me know if it was going to be more costly than originally expected). Based on the updated estimate, we determined that it just didn’t make sense to repair the car to street car condition. I picked up the car and brought it home in November and it’s been sitting in the garage since, collecting dust. Currently the front and rear bumpers are off the car, along with the lights on the passenger side. This spring, hopefully sooner rather than later, I will be stripping the SSC parts off the car and seeing if anyone wants to purchase those. I will also be selling the wheels which have Falken 660 tires on them. After that I will put the OEM suspension back on the car and see how much I can get for it. I really think it would be a good car to start a track/road racer build out of, but I simply don’t have the time or motivation to complete a project like that myself. The motor has ~42k miles on it and was very strong. Everything but the passenger side of the car was prestine, so who knows what I can actually get for the car. I won’t be parting it out individually at this point, unless I find some car that I think I can easily throw the motor into. If you’re looking for a track project car, feel free to reach out to me, let’s see if we can make a deal.  What’s next for me? Well right now I have an order in for a new Nissan Z, and a Ford F-250 truck. I have no idea when either of those will be built…. "

    "body": "2021/05/04 - So here we are, it’s 2021 already and you’ve hopefully started autocrossing again. We have had the car out to one two events so far. The first event was back on April 11th, a few days before we started writing this post (and are just now getting around to finishing). Tom S is codriving with me at most events this year, not sure how many out of town events he will be at, or heck how many out of town events I will be at. Event 1So event one. The weekend before the event I decided it was time to take all the rest of the vinyl off (sponsor/series decals) and with that came a load of residue and blemishes in the paint from the removal. 2 days before the event I went down to Detail Garage in Valley Park to pick up some supplies. I grabbed a Torq random orbital buffer, along with a number of other supplies so that I could try my hand at paint correction. I spent Saturday before event one paint correcting the car (all but the back of the rear end). I must say, I was totally pleased with the results. You can see a before and after of the top of the trunk on our Instagram. View on Instagram After getting the polishing done and throwing some wax on the car, I swapped the wheels/tires out for the set of brand new Falken RT660s and packed the car up to be ready to head out early in the morning. The event went well, though the car took some cone damage to the front end. I had removed the racer’s tape that had been holding some of it together, and failed to re-apply it after all the paint correction, I made sure to correct that a few days later. I ended up taking 1st in the class, and 2nd on PAX for the event. Tom was 3rd in PAX and we welcomed a newcomer to the St. Louis region, Juan, also in SSC, into the 7th place PAX spot. Juan is down near Springfield, MO and will be joining us for to liven up the competition this year. It wasn’t as productive an event as I would have liked, I always prefer to walk away with a PAX win, but Greer in his GT3 put almost 3/4 of a second in PAX time on me for the day. Here’s some side by side video of my fastest run (left) and Tom’s fastest run (right). Event 2Prep for Event 2 only consisted of swapping tires again and the previously mentioned tape work. Overall the event was sloppy, I had a hard time keeping clean and coned my fastest run (first corner before the start lights). Tom ended up taking the win in SSC for the event. I’ll try to get around to videos for that, not sure when I will!

    "title": "2020 Season review",
    "body": "2021/02/08 - 2020, the year that most people want to forget. It started out like any other year, a week into it though I was unemployed, getting let go for the first time in my life (that was’t a bad thing though, trust me). 8 weeks in, the world was starting to wake up to the realization that there was something going on with this virus thing. I was flying to/from Orlando at the end of February. I recall going through the airports thinking that anyone wearing a mask was over reacting, that being said, I wasn’t getting too close to anyone back then. A couple of weeks later I was driving to Stillwater Oklahoma for a bicycle event, waiting for the orange president to come on the air and do a broadcast of what was going on, half expecting to turn around and drive back to St. Louis. I went in to 2020 planning to run the FR-S competitively nationally, performning well at the Solo Nationals and then sell the car at the end of the season, ready to move on to something else after 3 seasons. The season was cut short, Nationally only attending one event (a win) with the Topeka ProSolo and I ended up not attending the first two local St. Louis region events as I was concerned with Covid-19 and the risks associated with that. It wasn’t until the third event, June 21st, that I really got out to compete. I ended up attending 7 of 9 St. Louis region events, taking the top PAX (index) finish at 5 of 7 events that I attended. For the year I ended up taking the index championship over Mitchell Coughran, 69,873 out of a possible 70,000 points. For the SSC class I ended up taking 7 of 7 class wins for the year. This was the second time (third if you throw the stupid 2008 double points event out) I took the overall index championship for the St. Louis Region SCCA, the last time being in 2013 in Dave’s street mustang (what was the class back then, rsr?, I really don’t recall). I was also awarded the Driver of The Year award for 2020. What’s next for 2021? Well I ended up deciding not to sell the car. I am signed up for the ProSolo SuperPass, which really doesn’t mean too much other than I get to sign up early for events to make sure I get it. You don’t earn points for the ProSolo Finale this year like in the past, so if you get a ProSolo win, you’re in for the finale, otherwise you might get in by attending enough events. I am signed up for the Dixie tour down in southern Georgia in the middle of March, and I will likely run the Topeka ProSolo and possibly Spring Nationals if I don’t do the Unbound Gravel (200 miles) ride in Emporia KS the week after Spring Nationals. Local eventwise, I’ll be hitting what events I can. Never say never on trying to repeat with the index championship. 2022, who knows, I imagine I will sell the FR-S at the end of this year, but again, never say never.

    "body": "2020/07/01 - Well that was a productive weekend! I left for Topeka Kansas on Friday morning after working for a few hours and stopped on the drive out for a few more phone calls that I needed to have. I stopped and went into two locations on the drive down, a QuikTrip in Wentzville Missouri, and a Chick-Fil-A in Blue Springs. The QT had no workers or customers (besides myself) wearing a mask. The Chick-Fil-A was still closed for indoor service and all staff were wearing masks while working the drive through lines. I was able to get out to Topeka in time get the Falken RT660s mounted on the car and to get some practice starts in with the new starting lights that they have going this year. My first impression of the lights, they change everything. In the olden days for ProSolo, back before LED lights, I used to leave when the second light was â€œgoing off”. With the LED lights introduced in the past couple of years, I would leave when the third light was coming on. With the 2020 version of the lights, I had to wait until the third light was on and then start the process of releasing the clutch to get the car to move. My first pass at the lights I turned a . 391 reaction time, where a . 500 is â€œprefect, and anything less than . 500 is RED. My second attempt resulted in a . 744, not red, but definitely not in the . 5-600 range that I expect when I’m starting. My third attempt was a . 575 much more respectable. I ended up taking 8 practice starts, and while I wasn’t really happy with them, I felt at least comfortable enough for the weekend that I didn’t buy more. Friday night I took the car by the car wash, grabbed a Vegan Lifestyle bowl from Chipotle and ran around to a couple of liquor stores in Topeka looking to add to my whiskey/bourbon collection. Friday night I spent my first night in a hotel with social distancing and cleaning in place. The Hampton Inn had the rooms â€œtapes” off with a seal that said they were clean, if the seal was broken you knew it hadn’t been cleaned. The elevator had a sign outside of it requesting that only 2 people use an elevator at a time. Overall the hotel experience was great, except for the fact that it was completely full with pre-teens running around on Saturday evening, obviously a sports tournament of some sort brought a lot of kids in, without any masks to be found.  Saturday morning I walked out of the hotel with the front desk person saying â€œstay dry”. I thought, oh it is just a little rain, then the doors parted and I saw that it was a torrential downpour. I navigated out to Heartland Park, going about 45 on the highway due to the conditions and the RT660s feeling a little skatier than I would have liked on the highway. Getting out to the event site, I was my usual self, the first person out walking the course. By the time I arrived, it was still raining and windy, but wasn’t the downpour from the hotel so I walked in just the rain jacket and flip flops for shoes. Went through one area where the standing/running water was a good 2” deep, but overall managed to not get myself too soaked. There was plenty of wind damage around the site however.  Saturday morning’s start was delayed due to lightning (as was Sundays) but by the time my group ran, it was pretty much dry, with conditions getting better as the morning went on. After the Saturday morning sessions I was sitting in 2nd behind Kinch out of Colorado. Saturday afternoon brought more of the same. I felt I was struggled on the right side course, where I felt a lot more comfortable on the left. Saturday afternoon I found . 15 seconds on the left, and just over . 3 on the right Saturday afternoon. My first run on Sunday morning I started on the right and couldn’t find any time, but found about . 17 on the left, putting me within striking distance of Kinch. My second right side run I hoped I would find another couple of tenths but struggled and was . 4 seconds slower than my best attempt on Saturday afternoon. Going into the last right on the left side I was pretty sure that I had no chance, and was going to have to settle for second place behind Kinch. I was pleasantly surprised when I came across on my last run with another . 13 second improvement, enough to give me a . 052 win over Kinch. This was my first ProSolo win. The car has won previously, multiple times, but for me, in twenty years of autocrossing, this was a first, and it was a blast! Winning your class in a Pro means you move on to the Challenge the second half of Sunday.  This was I believe my fourth attempt at a challenge, and likely the first time I’ve moved on passed the first round. I ended up paired up with James Harnish out of Arizona in the first round. I didn’t feel too great about my runs, but he ended up hitting a cone and that gave me the padding I needed to move on to the next round. Round number 2 I was lined up against Craig Wilcox. I’ve known Craig since 2003 or 2004 when we both raced 350Zs in B-Stock. He’s out of KC and has multiple national championships under his belt, while I, have none. Sitting at the back of the line waiting for the round to proceed Craig started running around debating on whether or not he needed to get gas for his SMF Honda, I selfishly started wondering if that might not play into my own advantage. It didn’t. If anything it took me out of my game. I realized just before pulling to the line that I hadn’t set my tire pressures. After round one I had gotten out and check them, but decided to set them closer to running. By the time I realized I didn’t actually set them, it was too late, I was strapped in the car and they were getting ready to send us to the line. I tried to put that out of my head and just head on out. My first run was once again on the Right side course. I fell asleep at the lights and left with a reaction time of . 993 almost half a second off of the ideal reaction time, and three tenths greater than what I would consider acceptable. I didn’t feel great on the run, but it is also the slower side that I struggled with all weekend, I came back with a 1. 001 deficit, almost . 5 on the light, and another . 6 on the slower course, I felt like that math worked. Going into the left side run I knew I was going to need to push it, and Craig might back off knowing he didn’t quite need to push as hard. I left on the last run with a . 623 reaction time and pushed as hard as I could to try to find time. I looked across to the other course as I came through the finish and I was quite a bit farther than Craig, I hoped deep down inside that it was enough. Once Craig crossed the line the announcer stated that I had made up over 8 tenths, but not the full second I needed, so I was done and Craig was moving on to the next round against Kinch. Here’s the video of my best left and right side runs (Sunday morning and Saturday afternoon respectively). The left side run uses my GoPro Hero8 with stability enabled, on a fixed mount on the roof of the car. The right side run uses the same camera with stability, but on my rotating mount. I honestly don’t feel like there is a big difference between the two mounts with the â€œhypersmooth” enabled in the GoPro Hero8.  My drive home on Sunday was uneventful, changed tires, loaded up the car, and hit the road. I averaged around 32mpg between Topeka and St. Louis, getting home just after dark so that I could unload the car and see the family before everyone fell asleep. Check out additional photos from the weekend.

    "body": "2020/06/23 - The time has come, Falken has updated the tire for SSC for 2020 with their latest and greatest Azenis RT660. I’ll save you all the story about how there was testing in September (I couldn’t stay for it), and how they were delayed getting to the states and you have the option of running either the RT-615k or the RT-660 for the 2020 season. All you really need to know is that the RT-660 is a much better tire, and highly recommended (required mostly) if you’re running the SSC autocross class with the SCCA. The tires are still a great price for SSC (as were the 615ks), I can currently get them from Tire Rack shipped to my door (or favorite installer) for $549! I ran my first local event on these tires 2 days ago, and I am still on a euphoric high from their performance and my placement at the top of the PAX/Index results. These tires are a huge upgrade over the 615ks. That’s not to say I didn’t like the 615ks, I feel they served as a great tire for 2 years in the infancy of the Solo Spec Coupe class, but the 660s are so much more. They are sticky. They are fun, they are competitive! I look forward to the rest of the 2020 season and have gone ahead and booked myself into the Topeka ProSolo this weekend in Kansas.

    "body": "2019/08/28 -  Where has the time gone? The 2019 season, at least Nationally, has come, and almost gone. The ProSolo Finale and TireRack National Championships are next week in Lincoln Nebraska, and SpecFRS. com will be there. But how did we get there? Let’s look back on the 2019 season. The season started out in with a test and tune in St. Louis on March 10th. To start the season off, Sean Greer was planning on running the car, so we took it to Family Arena and tried to work off the rust (from the drivers). We followed up the test and tune with a local event in St. Louis at the end of March, with Chris taking the win in SSC and Sean taking second, in the three car class. It would be June 9th before we had another local event. April brought the first ProSolo for the year, in Grenada Mississippi. Sean and I headed down through Memphis on Friday, stopping to buy some, only available in Tennessee, Jack Daniel’s bottles to add to the CollectorOfJack. com. Grenada had 14 drivers in the class, with 5 trophies. Chris took the 5th and final trophy spot with Sean taking third for the event, each of them besting the other on one side of the 2 sided ProSolo courses. Next was Lincoln Nebraska in late May for the Spring Nationals Champ Tour and ProSolo. In the ProSolo there were 16 drivers, 5 trophies. Chris managed to take 4th, while Sean finished in 8th for the Pro. The Lincoln Champ tour had 14 drivers, 5 trophies, with both Chris and Sean finishing in the trophies. Chris in 2nd, behind Kevin Dietz and Sean in 5th. Chris managed to pull out his best runs the last run each day. After Lincoln, Sean was pretty put off by the car, and decided that he wouldn’t be running it much going forward. Chris jumped straight into the local event scene and found success in 3 of the next 4 events, taking the SSC class win in all but one. At event #3 Tom Sotitopoulos, who co-drive last year, jumped in the car for the remainder of the season. In event 4 he managed to best Chris to take the class win. There are 4 more local events this year, as of right now Chris is holding down the class lead in points, and is setting in second place in PAX/Index for the year. With this difficult PAX number, it will be hard to take the index win for the year, but that is the ultimate goal, Chris trying to repeat what he did in 2013. So here we are, heading to Lincoln on Friday, towing the car down with a fresh set of Falken tires and the alignment reset our specs. The only thing we’ve changed this season is to adjusted air pressures down a bit in the back, from 31/31 to 31/30. No other changes from the car as to what we ran for settings last year.

    "body": "2019/01/31 - This post is coming 6 months (maybe more?) too late, but at least it is coming. The 2018 ProSolo Finale and Solo National Championships was a week of ups and downs for the team. The results were mixed across the board in terms of performance with some highlights and some down times as well. To start off the week we arrived for the ProSolo Finale on Friday, got the car off the trailer and waited for things to dry so that we could get some practice starts in on a drying start line. Everyone was waiting for dry conditions, and I wasn’t sure if that was going to happen, so I went out and took some starts to try to get a feel for the brand new Falkens that were on the car. Teddy took a couple of starts as well before the mad rush of people. The car needed some decals applied before everything got started, but overall was ready for the week of events. Saturday morning for the ProSolo Finale came with Teddie heading out in L4. She struggled on Saturday morning with red light and cone runs, but putting her fastest left side run down for the weekend on her 2nd attempt. I also went out with Red Light and Cone issues on my first runs on each side. On the 2nd attempt on the right side I laid down my fastest run, it was about 7/10ths off the pace needed for the class for the weekend. Saturday afternoon both Teddie and I were able to put down faster runs on the other side, but couldn’t quite make up the differences we wanted. Sunday morning it was wet and cold and barely anyone found time on the course, Teddie and myself finding none. Teddie ended up in 3rd in L4 (ssc) for the weekend, 1 out of trophies, but close enough to get into the ladies challenge bracket on Sunday afternoon. I on the other hand ended up in 14th place, out of 18 drivers, well over 2 seconds off the pace. To say I was displeased with my performance is an understatement. I spent the next few days wondering why I was going to stay in Lincoln for the next 5 days for the Solo Nationals. Sunday afternoon was a definite bright spot for the ProSolo Finale, Teddie ended up in the Ladies challenge and performed very well! She ended up making it to the semi final round before being knocked into the third place bracket. She ended up taking Third place to help salvage the weekend for both of us! I also headed out with my camera and shot a lot of the ProSolo challenge, having the most fun I had all weekend behind the lens of my camera.

    "body": "2018/06/06 - Wow, what a week! Last Wednesday I loaded up the SpecFRS onto a borrowed trailer and left St. Louis the following morning to drive to Lincoln Nebraska for spring Nationals, 4 days of racing. The drive out was uneventful, spent it trying to listen to old â€œThe Forward” podcasts, I’m not a huge podcast guy, even though I used to have my own back in the day, but I’ve been trying to listen to Armstrong’s podcast from the beginning, long drives are about the only time I can actually listen to it.  I arrived in Lincoln with plenty of time to get the car unloaded, teched, and over to practice starts to work on my lights for the weekend. I found the practice useful as I was able to knock down some Red Light issues that I had in Blytheville to only one RL all weekend in Lincoln. Friday morning, I talked Joe Tharpe into hoping into the car for the ProSolo as his C5 Z06 was out of commission due to a brake master cylinder failure. It was quite the change for him, hoping into a slow 4cyl, but he made the best of it all weekend! Joe finished in 7th in SSC for the ProSolo, only 1. 4 back from the lead in the class. With Spec being such tight competition it is easy to be a number of spots back, but close to the leader. I don’t know that Joe will be ditching his SSP Corvette anytime soon, but I think he had fun running in a car with half the horse power for a few days. Unfortunately on Sunday morning he took a spill while working the course and injured his shoulder, taking him out of competition for Sunday and Monday’s Champ Tour. Teddie Alexandrova drove the car all weekend in the ladies classes (L4 for the ProSolo, SSCL for the Champ Tour). She excelled! Friday/Saturday she ended up taking the win in L4 (her first ProSolo win), qualifying for the ladies challenge in the 4th spot. She cleaned up in the challenge and took her first Ladies challenge win as well! She had previously (Ft Myers Pro earlier this year) took the Bonus challenge win, so this was her first legit qualified challenge win.  In the Champ Tour Teddie went out on day one and put 2 tenths of a second on the open class, and 3. 6 seconds on the rest of the SSCL class. Monday, day 2 of the champ tour, saw her finish the win in SSCL with a 6. 7 second margin over the rest of SSCL and a time that would have been 2nd in the open class. Chris’ performance to start in the Pro was not up to his expectations. He started Saturday morning with a cone and red light, so only 2 of his first 4 runs were clean times. Finding a little bit of time on Saturday afternoon left him in 4th or 5th place in the 10 driver SSC class. Chris went into Day 2 with hopes of moving up, but was not optimistic about being able to catch James Yom who was leading the class. In what was likely a first for Chris, he was able to put down his two fastest times in the ProSolo on his final two runs, and moved up into the 2nd spot, . 244 back from Yom. This was Chris’ first self qualified Challenge entry as well, heading up against Brian Peters in the first round of the challenge. Unfortunately he exited the challenge in the first round down about a tenth to Peters. For the Champ Tour, Chris finished out day 1 way back, outside of the trophies, if you’ve ever seen Chris grumpy, it was one of those days. For Tom Sotiropoulos, also driving the car, Sunday was a great day! He went out on his final run and put a 1/2 second lead on the class. Monday the tide turned a bit. Chris went out on his first run and put down a time that would be 2 tenths faster than anyone else in the class (Tom put down the second fastest time), jumping up into the 2nd place position from 5th. Tom finished the day strong on his third run and took 1st for the event by 1. 1 seconds. Chris ended up losing one spot to Matt McCabe, to finish third for the event, 1/8th back from Matt.

    "body": "2018/05/03 -  In short, WOW. What an amazing weekend. I went into the weekend hopeful that I would drive the car well, and that I would be able to prove to myself that I can hang with the big dogs. I’ve been autocrossing for a long time (with a few gaps in between) and while I’ve had some spurts of random success outside of St. Louis, I have never felt confident that I could do it repeatedly. The idea of SSC, a Spec class in Solo, was very intriguing to me, as I wanted to try to rule out â€œI don’t have the right car”, from the equation. The weekend started out with me leaving St. Louis just after 1pm due to a company all hands meeting. I ended up getting down to Arkansas Aeroplex in Blytheville just after 5pm on Friday evening. I parked the car and met up with my co-driver for the weekend, Kevin Dietz out of Washington state. We discussed if there was a chance to do practice starts, or take a shot at the practice course. The practice starts were wrapping up, so I quickly unloaded the car and headed over. We ended up taking 7 practice runs between the two of us, and found the car to be rather pushy. At this point we debated what to do to try to correct for the pushiness. Kevin thought that we needed to try to fix it with alignment as we had already taken out all the front shock (set them at full soft). In my packing haste on Thursday evening I realized I forgot to pack my toe plates and camber gauge. Matt Hodges had set however, so we were covered there if we did decide to change the alignment. After much debate we decided that we wouldn’t change anything until after morning runs on Saturday. We went through tech, at which point I said hello to the other driver of the car for the weekend, Lori Gill out of Topeka Kansas. We got a few course walks in before sunset and then I headed off to Wal-Mart for the supplies I needed for a weekend of autocross, sunscreen, sandwich meats, drinks, ice and even a new cooler. Saturday morning started out with breakfast at the Perkins attached to the Holiday Inn, which took WAY too darn log for a serving of biscuits and gravy, I then headed to the event site and got a few course walks in on each side. From there it was time to finish the final prep on the car, which included getting a few more of the required decals mounted. Lori was the first driver up for the weekend, competing in L4, so I took the car over to grid to get her setup and ready for the 9am start time. Lori headed out and ran in L4 having a good showing for her first time in the car. When SSC was up in Group 3, I went out as first driver and had a red light on my left side runs. On the right side course I ended up with a cone on each run. That put myself in I believe 12th place out of 13 for the class. Even with that poor placement, I was pretty happy. I had fun driving the car, and without the cones and red lights, I was sure that I could hold my own in the car in the class if I cleaned things up. Kevin went out with the second driver pairings, and performed very well. He ended up sitting in the lead in SSC after the Saturday morning runs, and didn’t let that lead go all weekend. After the morning runs, and the performance of the car we decided that we didn’t need to make changes to the alignment and would run it as is. Being the leader, Kevin was now gridded at the front of the class, and went out on his Saturday afternoon runs and improved on his times on both sides by . 171. Me, being near the bottom of the pack got relegated to the second driver line, we decided to try setting the front shocks back up a little bit, so I turned them from full soft, 1/2 turn. I went out and on my first Saturday afternoon left side run and turned my two prior red lights into a coned run, but at least it was a time. On the right side I was able to clean up cones from the first two passes, and on my final run on the right side run make up more time. I managed to move up into 3rd spot, . 056 back from David Lousteau, and . 256 back from Kevin. Funny story, after my second left side run, I immediately headed to impound, I was stoked that I finally had a good run on the left and completely forgot that I needed to run one more run on the right. Lucky for me I was able to get back in line and get the right side run completed. Sunday morning Kevin and I both went out with the goal of improving things considerable. I was honestly hoping to catch him, and he was hoping to put down quick runs on his first runs to try and increase his lead on the class. He succeeded, I did not. Kevin managed to put his fastest times down for the weekend on his final run on each side. I managed to do my fastest on Sunday morning as well, but not near as fast as I think I could have been. Ultimately I finished in third place, a trophy spot, and Kevin took the win in the SSC class. Towards the end of the day I was sitting in 44th qualifying position for the Super Challenge, the 32 car bracket competition at the end of the ProSolo event. I put my name into the drawing to get into the 8 car bonus challenge, but with all of the people who ended up dropping out of the Super Challenge bracket I ended up getting in as the 32nd seed. Kevin got in as the 6th seed I believe. Super Challenge: With the bracket competition, each car lines up and runs their Class’ dial in time, which for me, meant in order to be fast, I needed to run Kevin’s fastest time for the right side, and left side. To account for this, each car that lines up in the bracket has a unique pattern to the lights at the starting line. For a slower car, such as SSC, that means we would typically leave BEFORE the car we are lined up against, with the idea being that if we both ran perfect times we would cross the finish line at exactly the same time. My first time in the Super Challenge was not uneventful. I went out on the right side course, lined up against the #1 seed, David Whitner. The right side course was slightly slower all weekend compared to the left side course, so when I came back, with an 8/10ths of a second difference from David I was pretty happy, knowing that I could probably make up that difference on the left side. When David and I lined up on the 2nd runs, I was on the left. The â€œchristmas tree”, the drag strip lights that tell us when to start, started coming down, but they came down first for David, and not for me as they should. I immediately thought something was wrong, but I couldn’t risk sitting there and not taking a run, so I left when my lights eventually dropped. That run on the left side was sloppy, I was not happy with it, but I was pretty stoked when I came in from the run and was told to get right back in the lane for the left side and to take another run. They had entered the dial in times incorrectly, so they needed us to run the course again. On my second time around the left course, the car felt MUCH better. Problem is, I picked up a cone early on in the process. I still pushed to get the car back across the finish with a decent time, but I couldn’t make up the deficit of the cone and I was bumped from my first Super Challenge attempt in the first round. Kevin ended up in the 2nd to last pairing out of the round of 32, lined up and defeated Chris Edens in an S2 Miata. The next round Kevin lined up against Russell Blume in his HS Mini Cooper and took him down as well. The third round was SSC #1 and #2 with David Lousteau lining up against Kevin. Again Kevin drove away victorious to line up against Mike King out of Florida, in his HS Ford. The final round had Kevin lined up against Jonathan Warlof in a blue Mustang. I can’t do justice with words the excitement I had of that final round, so I would encourage you to watch the video from my Facebook Live session. Here’s the video from on top of the car of Kevin’s Super Challenge win.

    "body": "2018/04/16 - Today was the first St. Louis Region Solo event in the 2018 series, so it was the first time out in the car, and I must say, it was great (albeit cold, windy, and even snowing/sleeting/raining at times)! Natalie got to take the first runs in the car, actually the first 6! She hasn’t seriously autocrossed since 2008 when we had the Corvette, but I believe this year will be different and she’ll run quite a few local events and then we’ll see if I can’t talk her into Solo Nationals as well. Natalie managed to get down to a 51. 997 on her 4th run, but trying harder on run 5 and 6 she went the other direction on the clock. We’ll see where she placed within the ladies challenge once the results are published later this week.  My turn to run was the third heat, which surprisingly started just around 1pm or maybe a little after. (The STL region really had their stuff organized for event #1, definitely ran smoothly considering it was the first event of the year). There were 3 other drivers in SSC today in St. Louis, Michael Kopec and a gentleman from Troy, IL who was out in his car at his first autocross! That takes some commitment, getting into autocross in a spec class right off the bat, hope to see him at more local events this year. My first run I went out and ran a 47. 477, though I plowed through 3 cones after the finish (might as well get my own cone cherry popped on my first run in the car). My second run I went just under a tenth of a second faster, but picked up a cone on the front portion of the course. My 3rd, 4th, and 5th runs ended up getting faster, each separated by a couple of hundredths. I was ultimately able to get my fastest clean time down to 46. 497, . 832 ahead of Kopec for the day. Settings:  Front Swaybar: Soft setting Rear Swaybar: Stiff Setting Front Konis: 1 turn from soft Rear Konis: 1. 5 turns from soft Front Tire Pressure: 35 psi Rear Tire Pressure: 34 psiOn my 6th run the course started to get slick due to the rain/sleet, and I ended up losing control on the back half of the course. On the way home the car felt funky, so I stopped and took the turns out of the Konis. I ended up noticing that the steering wheel was off-center, and then I noticed that both the ABS and SLIP lights were on the dash. I scanned the OBD2 with my Torque app to see if there were any codes being thrown for those two lights, but wasn’t able to find anything. My internet research, and help from the SSC group on Facebook leads me to believe that the alignment (wheel being crooked) is what is causing the lights. I’ll head over to SPS this week and see what I screwed up when I spun today! Overall I’m stoked about how much fun I had in the car today. I didn’t win PAX, but I didn’t expect to, the PAX for this class doesn’t appear to be close to a valid equalizer for 2018. I will be surprised if I get in the top 2 on PAX at all this year locally, but we’ll see, maybe I’ll be surprised. I’m looking forward to the Misfit Toys event next weekend, and the Blytheville ProSolo the following weekend! "

So I took my car to the only place I trust for an autocross alignment in Missouri, Solo Performance Specialties. The tires mounted up nice and easy on the Konig Ampliforms, after I got the wheels with the right bolt pattern of course. They were mounted onto the car and it was up on to the alignment rack next.

Earlier this week I went to SoloPerformance to mount my Falken Azenis RT615k+s to my newly purchased Konig Ampliforms (courtesy of MotorsportsAmmo. com), I got one of the wheels ready on the tire machine and was about to mount one of the Falkens when Dave and I remembered we needed to deal with TPMS. Due to some new sensors that he purchased and an incompatibility with the FR-S, we spent an hour trying to upgrade the scanner’s firmware to make the TPMS devices work for the Scion FR-S. While researching if I could run without TPMS, I came across a post that mentioned a 5x100 bolt pattern wheel. At this point I freaked out and started researching if I in fact ordered the wrong bolt pattern for my 2016 Scion FR-S. I, in fact, did. I emailed MotorsportsAmmo. com to see if there was a chance that I could return the wheels and try to get the proper bolt pattern. They were great, they quickly got me an RMA, and Dave at SPS shipped them back for me. I should have the new, proper bolt pattern, 5x100, in hand on Monday and hopefully will be able to get them mounted and an alignment done next week before my first local autocross in SSC, August 15th in St. Charles MO, www. stlscca. org.

    "body": "2018/04/02 - After a long couple of days working on the FR-S, interspersed with family events and other activities, I finally have the suspension components installed on the FR-S.  If you’re interested in doing the installation yourself, be sure to check out the TireRack write-up. I am not going to recreate the write-up, it covers a lot of what you need to know, I am going to cover some of the items that I feel the write-up misses. First things first, don’t try to just go based off of the TR write-up, you should also read any of the instructions that come with the parts you ordered. I made the mistake of trying to just use the write-up and got burned on a few items, had I just read all of the instructions first I would of saved myself some headache.    Two plastic fasteners for lower plastic panel covering sway bar mount. Swing panel out of way.   Three upper strut nuts (12).   One bolt towards the front for the sway bar mount (14).   One nut underneath towards the rear for the sway bar mount (12). This can be accessed from below through a hole in the frame member by removing the two bolts (10) holding that side of the flexible cover.   Remove sway bar from passenger side with shock assemblies out on both sides. Twist ends to the rear.   Note: If the cover does not give enough access, then the metal shield with four cover bolts (10), six shield bolts (12), and six plastic fasteners may have to be removed. One each of the three plastic fasteners on each side is underneath the fender liner towards the front. This is where I diverged from the instructions, getting to the sway bar mounts, I have no idea how anyone could remove the sway bar without removing the subframe connectors. I ended up taking both the metal tray under the engine, and the composite tray over the exhaust/transmission from the car in order to remove the subframe connectors which then drops the sway bar out of the car. Also in the Notes, there are 7 plastic fasteners on my car, one in the middle, that holds the metal tray. Next up was removal of the upper mount bearing from the stock strut. I ended up removing this without using a spring compressor, though I wouldn’t recommend it. I have a bruise on my wrist from the mount popping off when the nut came free, definitely learned a lesson on this one! I did end up using the spring compressors to install the Eibach springs on the Konis up front. When assembling the front Struts, and the rears, be sure to figure out your dust boot situation. The Eibach springs, come with 2 new dust boots, I ended up putting these on the front struts, though other people have said they installed them on the Rear and reused the OEM fronts on the Koni fronts. I ended up using the OEM rear boots on the rear with the Konis and Eibachs.  Install new lower SPC camber bolt (15) with nut (17) to the front. Tab on SPC bolt horizontal to the outside for approximate maximum camber. The next point of clarification is related to the bolts used on the bottom of the front struts, there are two. When installing the new struts, use the SPC camber bolt on the bottom hole, and use the original bottom bolt (oem) in the upper hole. You can tell the difference between the two bolts by looking at the shafts. The original TOP bolt is thicker on one side, the bottom one is uniform and will give you more adjustment for camber by installing it at the top position. I saved the original top bolt with all the rest of the OEM parts. How do you mount the SPC bolt? Read the instructions here. Moving on to the Rear of the car, you’ll come across this in the instructions:  Three upper shock nuts (12). That line is incorrect, it should be Two upper shock nuts, and I think they are 14s, not 12s. Putting the rear shocks together, I ended up using the spring compressor to remove the OEM upper mount, but assembling the Konis I ended up compressing it by hand. I was able to press down on the shock mount enough to thread the nut onto the shaft of the Konis and run the nut down by hand with a socket. This is a much easier job if you have a second person to assist, one to compress and one to turn the nut down.   TRD Lowering Springs install guide"

    "body": "2018/03/27 - I have been scouring the interwebs for a good month or so looking for the perfect FR-S for my SSC build, and came across the one via Autotrader. I reached out to the dealership via Autotrader, and also via TrueCar. com to see what kind of deal I could get on the car. The asking price was $18,499, via the TrueCar inquiry they immediately dropped $125 from the price, though the TrueCar quote was adjusted to include a $598 dealer documentation fee, for a total price of $18,972.  I managed to talk the dealer down about $1k from that price, and after Brian Johns from Carpartment stopped by the dealer to check it out for me, I placed a deposit via the phone on Friday night the 9th. Just over a week and a half ago I hitched a ride with Dave from SoloPerformance. com down to the Dixie Champ Tour in Adel, Georgia. On the way down we stopped in Murfreesboro, Tennessee at Toyota of Murfreesboro to pick up my new SSC ride, a 2016 Scion FR-S. Because we were on our way down to the Champ Tour, and we wanted to try to swing by the Jack Daniel’s Distillery, we were sort of in a rush when we arrived at the dealer with the truck and trailer in tow. I was hoping to get in and out of the dealership in under 2 hours, which, unfortunately, is impossible with car dealers. I performed a quick test drive of the car, and looked her over to see what condition it was in. Overall I was disappointed as I had been told that the car would be detailed before I arrived, but it was far from detailed. It had a rough surface, some sort of film/overspray over most of the car, (top, windows, hood) that was very rough to the touch. It wasn’t bad enough that I would change my mind on the car, I figured I would just detail it myself when I had the time and get it cleaned up. After that, we tried to move forward with the paperwork, I had pre-approval paperwork ready to go from my bank, and even with that it took about 2. 5 hours after we arrived before I was back on the road trying to catch up with Dave and his dad who headed off to Lynchburg to take a tour of the distillery.

    "title": "What is SSC? Solo Spec Coupe",
    "body": "2018/03/08 - Solo Spec Coupe. SSC. The next big thing in SCCA Autocross. What is SSC? In September 2017, the Sports Car Club of America announced the creation of a new breed of autocross competition, a Spec class. Why does SCCA need a Spec class in Autocross? I say why not! Who doesn’t want to take â€œcar selection” out of the mix in autocross? If you can successfully do that, you open up the idea of a true driver’s class, a real skill competition pitting driver against driver. What cars are part of SSC?: For now the class is built around the 2013-2016 Scion FR-S and Subaru BRZ, otherwise known as the Twins. These two cars were built in a partnership with Toyota and Subaru. They share a platform, similar looks, and the same 2. 0 liter Subaru boxer engine. The cars are equipped similarly, with the Subaru having slightly more â€œup-scale” refinements. What modifications are legal in SSC?: The SPEC portion of the class means you can run only the specific parts, and anything outside of these are not legal in the class. The published parts here are from the SCCA’s SSC page.  KoniÂ® Sport (Yellow) struts/shocks w/ tamper-proof seal EibachÂ® PRO-PLUS Performance Handling Package (springs and adjustable anti-roll bars) SPC PerformanceÂ® Adjustable Alignment Kit (camber bolts, adjustable lower control arms, and toe arms) Tires: Falken Azenis RT615K+ (225/45R17).  Wheels: 17”x8”, 17 pounds minimum, wheel offset +40 (40ET) or greater. In addition to the publish parts, you can also read all of the Class Rules. Unlike most other classes in SCCA Autocross, this class doesn’t â€œbuild” on anything other than the ruleset here. You can’t take an STX build and add these parts to make it an SSC car, you need to remove any modifications not listed in the rules in order to be legal for the class. Spec in this case also means the tires. The Falken Azenis RT615K+ (size 225/45R17) is the required tire for the class, any other tire, more performant, or less performant, would be outside of the rules of the class. Which car is the best to have for the SSC class?: The whole idea of the class is that there isn’t one car that is best, ideally any choice of FR-S or BRZ, and any year, should ideally work. Will it play out that way? We will see. The class is brand new, there has been one SCCA National event so far this year. The Dixie Champ Tour is coming up, and currently has 11 cars registered, so we will see what happens as the year progresses. One thing to keep in mind in terms of car selection is Contingency money. Toyota has stepped up to offer a contingency for SSC at ProSolo events with $200 for the class win, and $1,000 for a year end class win, plus an additional $1,000 for a year end challenge win. I don’t believe Subaru has any contingency program available for 2018 at least at this point in time (March 2018). Is the class a Supplemental class?: This is a common question, and the reason it is asked is because the supplemental tag in National autocross means that the class doesn’t qualify for a National Championship. Typically supplemental classes are trials, new classes, that need some testing to see if they will work out.  This is exactly what SSC is right now, supplemental, a test. That being said, in the Town Hall event that the SCCA held at the end of February 2018, the question was asked if it will continue to be a supplemental class. The response was, yes, it currently is, but there’s a chance that will change. So there is hope that SSC will qualify for a National Championship in 2018. "

Photos from 11/26/2016 Pictures available on Instagram Videos available on another Instagram account Why is the car for sale?: I simply struggled with the car this year. I think the car can be competitive, I had some very competitive runs in it this year, enough to be near the top at National competitions, but I was unable to put multiple good runs in with the car, my head just wasn’t in it all year. I need to change, do something else for 2017, maybe even take a year or two off and focus on other things. There’s no reason for me to hold on to the car if I’m not going to autocross it, so I would rather see it go to someone who will use it. What I would do if I were keeping the car?: If I were going to keep the car, and there is always that chance, what would I do to it for 2017? The remaining projects to get the car fully prepped would include headers and high flow cats, a lighter exhaust, and then a full tune on the car. That is really the only thing I think that is necessary to finish the car off for STU.

    "body": "2016/08/21 -  So the 2016 ProSolo series is nearing its end, with the final two events of the year being held within 6 hours of the house, I entered both. The Wilmington event turned out to be another disappointing one for me, not because of the location or people, but simply due to my lack of ability to drive this car lately. I ended up disconnecting the rear sway bar after the Saturday morning runs, that made a world of difference on the car. I was finally able to control the car without constant fear of the back end breaking free on me. That being said, the back end did plenty of braking free all weekend, mainly through the finish! I didn’t end up getting the times I needed to in the car, finished somewhere 5th or 6th place, not even worth remembering! The Blytheville ProSolo went just about the same, though because there were only 2 of us in the class, and the other guy’s car broke, I took home 20 points for the event in STU. I didn’t fair well in the bump class however, so there was no challenge for me. Off to the ProSolo Finale here coming up in 2 weeks, then SoloNationals, hoping that I can fair better there than I have all year. There’s also one local event coming up as well, perhaps that event will be the season’s turning point! Stay tuned for a new look on the 350z in the next few days. "

    "body": "2016/07/11 - So here we are, another month has gone by since the last blog post, time for an update here on the status of Project350z. TL;DR: Crap So at the end of April I headed to Peru Indiana for the Gateway Autocross Association event at Grissom, I stuffed 4 tires into the 350z and headed on my way Friday afternoon.     View this post on Instagram      A post shared by Project350z (@project350z) How did the event go? It was darn cold, and I didn’t dress for darn cold. I ended up leaving Sunday morning and driving home on the RE-71Rs (drove up on the Hankooks) because I was worried about hitting some rain on the way home, and knew that the Kooks would try to kill me with some water on the ground. The following weekend I headed off to Wilmington Ohio. This time I wasn’t taking an extra set of tires with me, I found out on Wednesday evening that the 285/30-18 RE-71Rs I ordered from The Tire Rack came in, I was fortunate enough to be able to have them delivered to Wilmington Friday afternoon. I spent a couple of hours at the Tire Discounters there in Wilmington as they got the old tires off and the new tires on. The event didn’t go so well, I just didn’t feel like I could get the car as fast as it needed to be, compared to other cars, I was off the pace for sure.     View this post on Instagram      A post shared by Project350z (@project350z) After Wilmington was a local event in which I ran the 275 tires again on the XXR 531 wheels. Tom S. drove with me for the event. Before the event I decided it was time to put the rear sway bar on the car, when I got the car it was removed. It felt much better, Tom and I finished 4th and 5th respectively on the PAX for that event (#4). From there it was time to head to Lincoln, Nebraska for the Spring Nationals, both the ProSolo and the Championship Tour events. I managed to talk my father into driving out to Lincoln from Tucson, Arizona in his RV, mom flew on to Boston and her 50th college reunion, so dad and I got to spend a few great days together on the tarmac in Lincoln. The events didn’t do so great, the ProSolo I finished 5th out of 7 in the class. The only saving grace was my final run, after a red light of course, I managed to run the 2nd fastest class time on the right side. It wasn’t worth anything, would have moved me up 1 spot, still out of trophies, but to me that made the whole weekend, I finally proved to myself that the car can do it,. The weekend ultimately was a story of me not being able to do it, but the car was capable. Rust, lots and lots of rust in the head. After the ProSolo they held the National Tour (Champ tour). I finished better overall, there were 14 drivers in the tour, versus 7 in the Pro. I finished 7th, 2 out of trophies. Though I never did get the feeling I got on my last run of the ProSolo, the fast feeling. After the poor showings in the National events I decided it was time to tear the car apart and see if change is what I need. I decided it was time to put the â€œold” suspension back on the car. What is the old suspension you might ask, well you can read about it here, I never did sell the suspension off the old car, so I decided it was time to try that out. The car has been up on jack stands for a month now, I finally got around to getting everything finished up today. One additional thing I installed, there was a little issue with the potential legality of the previous camber arms on the rear end of the car. The arms came on the car when I purchased it, but I decided I didn’t want to run the risk of them being challenged with a protest at a future event. So I ordered the Kinetix Racing Rear Camber/Traction package "

    "body": "2016/04/23 - So it has been a while since I’ve had the time to get a blog post up here, so let’s get started. After the last post, the car was almost ready for the Dixie National tour, held in Cecil Georgia, but there was some final prep to do. I took the car down to Solo Performance to corner weight and align the thing, with good results.  Alignment Specs::       Total Weight (empty / driver)   3099lbs   3351lbs         Front Camber (LF / RF)   -3. 5   -3. 7       Front Toe (LF / RF)   -1/32”   -1/16”       Rear Camber   -2. 9   -2. 7       Rear Toe   5/32”   5/32”   Total empty weight was with all loose items removed (spare tire, tools, carpeting). Total weight with driver using additional weight to mimic driver. St. Louis Region Test &amp; Tune: The corner weight/alignment was completed just in time for the St. Louis region’s impromptu Test &amp; Tune. The weather didn’t pan out well, cold and wet, but the region did a great job of throwing together a last minute T&amp;T at Gateway Motorsports Park on March 13th. Due to the weather, not much was done in terms of actually testing and tuning, I used the event as a driver shakedown to try to get the winter rust out of my head, I also used it as a trial test of towing the car behind the 2008 Tahoe. Dixie National Tour: For the Dixie National Tour, Natalie and I towed the car down to Georgia (thanks to Izzy’s for the trailer). We went down a couple of days early to spend a day with one of my bosses hiking through beautiful Amicalola Falls State Park. After the hike and staying a night in the cabin, we headed down through Atlanta. I don’t know if I have ever had a good time driving through Atlanta, and this trip was probably the worst in terms of our experiences. Waze took us through downtown, getting off the highway, to try to avoid some of the accidents on the highway, but Waze obviously didn’t know we were pulling a car on a trailer, because the route was definitely not ideal for the rig. We ended up in Valdosta Georgia a day earlier then planned, which ended up making things much easier on us Friday when we got up, washed the car, and headed out to the event site, the South Georgia Motorsports Park. Friday morning we parked, unloaded the car and headed over to the practice course to try to get more of the rust off (the driver). Practice went pretty well, though it was crazy busy, so long waits between the practice runs. Brian (former car owner) ended up taking some runs as well as he was going to be co-driving with me for the Dixie Tour. After practice runs I made Natalie head out for a bicycle ride with me, it was our first time experiencing riding for your life while being chased by some very angry dogs. Other than the dogs, the ride was flat, fast and great exercise.  Saturday and Sunday for the Tour went well. Saturday morning started out wet, we ran first heat, but it was drying, so there was definitely an advantage to being second driver if you had two drivers, as the surface was getting dryer/faster every additional run. At the end of Saturday runs I was sitting in second place in the 7 driver STU class. Brian was sitting in the 3rd and final trophy spot. Sunday we both drove well, all driver’s in the heat benefited from dry runs. Both of us ended up falling back, myself one position to finish third (final trophy spot) and Brian back two, to fifth for the weekend. I was pleased with the result, and happy to finally have fun in the car, I was beginning to worry I wasn’t going to enjoy autocrossing this 350z after the first two events I had done in it. Post Dixie National Tour: From Dixie, the car was loaded up on the trailer and headed to Chattanooga (with Brian), while Natalie and I headed south to Orlando for a few days at a work convention. On the way back up to Chattanooga on Thursday morning to get the car, Brian sent me a txt telling me that someone had attempted to break into the car while it was sitting on the trailer at his shop. Somehow they were unsuccessful at getting in, but they did manage to bang up the driver’s door and window (about $1500-2,000 worth of damage).  Jack Daniel’s: The drive back through Atlanta was fun again, lots of accidents and idiots, along with the fact that I had the news about the car, it wasn’t a very fun day. We picked the car up and drove up to Tullahoma to stay the night, before heading to the Jack Daniel’s distillery on Friday morning.  St. Louis Region Event #1: The first local SCCA autocross in St. Louis was held on Sunday April 3, 2016. Overall the event went okay, I won the STU class by a couple of seconds, but ended up in 7th on the overall index. Not exactly the position I was hoping for. The car drove well, I feel like I just didn’t drive it to the full extent of how it can be driven, and my position on Index showed that result.  Local Event #2: Event #2 of the St. Louis 2016 series was held this past Sunday at the Family Arena in St. Charles. Once again, I finished on top in the STU class, but this time in 8th overall on Index. Again, there was more in the car, though I don’t know if there was a full 1. 2 seconds more, which is what I would have needed to move in front of the STF index winner.  Tire Pressures and Shock Settings: My current tire pressures I’ve been running on the RE-71Rs is 31F/29R Front Shocks at 9 clicks Rear shocks at 1 full rotation (can’t get the darn clicks working on the back) Trying out SoloStorm: One thing I will be doing this year is trying to improve my driving. I find that overall my instincts are â€œpretty” good as to where I can go fast, and where I can’t, my gut gets me pretty far. But I honestly don’t think it gets me far enough. I have a hard time â€œimproving” on autocross runs typically, meaning I’ll go out and put down a pretty quick time, but not improve much over the next 2 runs (more if local events), which means I am oftentimes not getting all that I should be out of the car, or myself. I am going to try to improve my driving through the use of technology, and the hot tool right now for that in Autocross is an Android app called SoloStorm, from petreldata. com. With SoloStorm you can analyze the data from your runs quickly from an Android tablet inside of your car. In the past I’ve tried to look at data from the DL-1, on a laptop, between runs, but it was clunky and not easy enough to do that quickly. With SoloStorm you are able to look at runs, segments, and compare where you are faster or slower, this can be extremely useful when you have two drivers as you can compare your run to the other driver to see where you can each improve. What’s Next?: Next weekend (April 30, May 1st) I’ll be at the Grissom Classic in Peru Indiana, and the following weekend I’ll be at the Wilmington ProSolo. See you out at an event! "

    "title": "Weekend progress on the 350z",
    "body": "2016/03/07 - It was a good weekend on the 350z, I made progress on pretty much everything I needed/wanted to do to start the 2016 season, with only the corner balance and wheel alignment remaining. Those are scheduled for Monday at Solo Performance. Here’s a rundown of what I was able to accomplish this weekend:  Oil/Filter Change Plenum Spacer Removal Upper and Lower intake manifold cleaning Lower engine splash guard installed Passenger front fender liner replaced Replaced bolts for strut tower brace PlastiDip’d strut tower brace Replaced missing plastic clips all around the front end, top and bottomWhen I removed the upper intake, to remove the Plenum spacer I found that the inside was a disgusting mess. I sprayed it with some carb cleaner before seeing â€œnot recommended on fuel injected vehicles” on the can, so I headed off to pick up some throttle body/intake cleaner. Ideally, I would have taken the entire lower manifold off and cleaned it, but I didn’t have the lower gasket and after spending all day on the car I was anxious to finish up for the evening. I cleaned it up, but it still could be better (See photos below). After getting it all back together, I wasn’t able to start the car, initially it started and ran for a moment, but after that it wouldn’t fire. I went to bed dejected, worried I had done something to damage the car. While laying in bed I started to question if I had reconnected the throttle body, so first thing in the morning when I awoke I went out to the garage to check, and sure enough, I hadn’t fully connected the throttle body. I connected that up, and later in the morning after grabbing the keys I was able to start the car up without any problems. In addition to the work on the 2003 350z, I also spent a bit of time working on a friend’s 2014 Corvette Stingray. He’s had it for 2 years now, with just over 6k miles on it, and after the brakes get warmed up it has a pretty annoying squeal/squeak that happens during low speed stops. He’s had the service bulletin for â€˜14s done but that didn’t help with the brake noise, so I have the car for a week or two to try and correct it. After being able to reproduce the problem, I determined that it appeared to be coming from the rear of the car. I took the rear pads off, applied some anti-squeal to the back of the pads and then drove it 100 miles this weekend around town, so far it appears that the problem has been resolved, but I’ll drive it a few more times before he returns to see if it is truly fixed.

    "title": "How to drop 40lbs from your 2003 350z, new seats!",
    "body": "2016/02/29 - This weekend I spent some quality time finally working on the 350z before the upcoming autocross season (Dixie Champ Tour is coming up quickly). In prep for STU, I want to see what kind of weight I can get out of the car. I really don’t know if this car (2003 Touring) can come anywhere close to what my first one (2003 Enthusiast, 3075lbs) weighed, or even the second one (2004 enthusiast, 3062). I have yet to get it up on the scales, but I assume going into this that the car is heavier than both of them. The power, heated, leather seats that came with the car, along with the potential extra stereo equipment, and electronics for the VDC mean the car likely weighs a good bit heavier than the previous cars. A week or two ago, I headed out to Solo Performance to try on a few different seats. I wanted something that would drop weight and add some rigidity and support. SPS has quite the selection of seats, and had an NRG Innovations FRP-310, which is their medium, fixed back seat. I’m 6’4” and weigh 250lbs (working on dropping that weight as well), and I actually fit semi-comfortably in this seat. I chose to go with the NRG Innovations FRP-300 instead however, this seat is the Large version of the one that SPS had in the shop. We weighed the seats, along with a mount, on the SPS shipping scale and were shocked at what we found, the scale read what we thought was 9 pounds for the seat and 4 pounds for the mount. Dave at SPS also ordered me a set of BuddyClub Racing Spec Super Low Seat Rail Kit Nissan 350Z/G35 03-09 to mount the seats into the car. All the parts arrived early last week, so I headed over to the shop on Sunday to work on removing the old seats and putting in the new ones.

All the parts arrived early last week, so I headed over to the shop on Sunday to work on removing the old seats, and putting in the new ones.  It is good to have a friend in the business, while I could have installed the seats in my own garage, having others around while working on the car and watching various other work get done on customer vehicles is motivating. Installation of the seats is fairly straightforward, but it did take me far longer than I expected. The main problem I ran into is that, at 6’4”, I needed to have the seats in the lowest position possible when mounting them (driver’s side all 4 corners on the lowest setting, passenger side 3 of the four, due to a hump in the passenger floorboard at the tunnel). Getting the seats onto the Buddy Club rails at the lowest position was easy to do when I didn’t tighten everything down and test fitted the installation, but as soon as I tried to tighten everything down I pretty much had to try it multiple times to get things lined up correctly so that the rails didn’t hit the bottom of the seats, and the holes in the rails lined up with the bolt holes in the floor. Even with all the test fitting I did, after getting them mounted in I find that the sliders are binding up. Fortunately, I can move the driver’s seat enough to make myself comfortable, but anyone shorter is going to have troubles, so hopefully, I can work out the binding issues down the road. 350z Seat Weight: When I got the seats and rails mounted, I decided to weigh them, I was shocked at what I found, 11lbs. I then put the stock seats on the scale, and they weighed in at 19lbs. This was going to be a problem, in SCCA Autocross, STU class, you can replace the seats, but if you do, the replacement must weigh 25 lbs. What advantage would I have of replacing my 19lb seat with a 25lb seat? Is the “grip” worth the extra 6 pounds? The more I thought about it, the more something had to be wrong with the scale. There’s no way the stock seats only weighed 19 lbs. So off to grab a 25lb plate Dave had around the shop for help in corner weighting and alignment. I threw that on the scale, and boom, 11lbs. Wait, what? A quick check of the scale’s display and we realized that the scale was in kilograms. So how much did they weigh? Well, the stock seats weighed in passenger 43. 5lbs and driver 44. 85 lbs, the NRG FRP-310s with Buddy Club rails, weighed in at 24. 45lbs (passenger) and 25lbs (driver).       Description   Weight         OEM Touring Leather   45lbs       NRG FRP-310 w/ Buddy Club Brackets   25lbs   To get the passenger seat legal, I stuck 1/2 pound of lead wheel weights on the bottom of the seat. After reviewing the pictures I took, I saw that when I weighed the Passenger Side seat, I didn’t have the slider arm on it, that might have made up for my weight difference. How do they fit? Well, they fit the driver great, while they aren’t all that comfortable for ingress/egress of the vehicle, when sitting in them they are amazing, I don’t plan to do long road trips in them (hello trailer, soon) I think I could drive to/from Kansas City for an autocross in relative comfort. Door Panels: The ONLY problem with the seats, the large (didn’t test the medium size) is a little too wide up top for the stock door panels on the 350z. The doors press against them when they close, and due to the styrofoam body of the panels, they now have indentations in them from the doors pressing against the seats. I figured I have two options, 1) shave the seats down, removing the cover to file them or 2) leave them as is and not care about the door panels. I’m going with option 2 for now, the car has a specific purpose, and that is to autocross, if I ever get annoyed by the indentations/damage to the panels perhaps I can find panels to replace them. Seat Height: The one thing I didn’t test, is how the seats will do with a helmet on. I have a feeling I will likely rub a little bit on the top, but if necessary, I can always pull the padding from the bottom of the seat (and be sure to add weight) to drop down an inch or two in the seat while autocrossing. With times for autocross being fairly short, sitting without padding for those periods shouldn’t be a huge deal. Check out some of the installation photos with close up shots of the various weights of the seats. "

After popping the tire off the wheel we quickly found that the wheel had a repair attempted both inside and outside of the wheel, it actually looked like someone had taken JB Weld to it. The repairs had cracked through, and the wheel was out of round, first we rolled it on the floor to see, then put it on the balancer, and it definitely was out of whack. Instead of even trying to repair the wheel I ordered another one from NLMotoring, it was $165 shipped, so it just made sense to order a new one than to worry about another repair weakening the wheel even further and constantly working about it leaking in the future. These wheels aren’t what I would choose if money weren’t an option, but money is always a factor in racing, and these are the wheels that came with the car, so they will have to do until I get some CCW Wheels from SPS. Here’s what the 350z looks like on the XXR 531 18”x11” in Chromium Black, they do look pretty darn good for a wheel that you can get for $165 shipped.  "

    "body": "2016/01/03 - When I picked up the 350z in Chattanooga back in November, I figured out that the radio wasn’t great, the sound was weak, and it didn’t appear to pick up any FM signals whatsoever. Over the Xmas weekend I decided it was time to rip into the car to remove the stock Bose amp and subwoofer (behind the driver’s seat) as well as try to tack down why the FM reception was non-existent. The first step was to get into the subwoofer location behind the driver’s seat, a quick screw driver inserted into the panelling to pop the cover off. pry and then pull it off. Once I removed the cover, I quickly found that the stock Bose setup had already been removed, I figured that might be the case, but wasn’t 100% sure until we pulled the cover off. While in there I took the time to clean up some of the stray wiring that was in there, some exposed wires, and some live power wires that simply had electrical tape wrapped around them. After working on the (lack there of) Sub, it was time to rip into the dashboard. I’ve done it so many times on my prior 350zs that it is straightforward and fairly painless to do. The one thing that gave me trouble was disconnecting the wiring harness from the center console where the harness powers the hazard, and seat warmer switches. I ended up pulling the panel up and off of the emergency brake in order to get to the plug for the wiring. Once I pulled the plastic for the console out of place I dug in behind the stereo itself. First thing I checked was to see if the antenna wiring was plugged into the head unit, unfortunatly it was, so that wasn’t going to be an easy fix! I tracked down some wires from the stereo by pulling down the manual from the Pioneer website. One thing I did find was there is the “mic” for the handsfree bluetooth setup was plugged into the “wired remote” port on the back of the head unit. I unplugged that, but unfortunately couldn’t plug it into the proper MIC input as the jack was the wrong size. I plugged the mic back into the W/R port and started playing around with the headunit to see if I could get any stations tuned. While digging in the center console compartment I found a wireless remote for the stereo, thinking that might work with “options” better than the touch screen I try to start using that, with no success. I checked the battery in the remote, and found it was a CR2016, but the remote said it took a CR2025, so I grabbed a spare and popped that in place. Ends up, that didn’t work either, no matter what I tried I couldn’t get the remote to work. Until I once again unplugged the mic from the “wired remote” port, one I did that the remote started working properly. So apparently whomever installed this radio, the wiring was done incorrectly on the MIC, and that was causing problems. I went ahead and left the MIC unplugged and put everything back together in the car. I immediately tried to tune FM, and found that I could actually tune to a specific station, where previously I was only able to scan, and with the lack of signal previously, the scan would continue until manually stopped by switching input sources. I still wasn’t able to get a clear tune on a station, but when I pulled the car out of the garage to reposition where it was parked, I did find that it started to get a signal to a local radio station here. So it looks like the ultimately problem with the radio may just have been the miswired Mic, we’ll see, next time I drive the car, how things play out. It might be a while though before I get back out in the Z, it has turned cold here in Missouri and I don’t plan to drive the car too much in below freezing temps, due to the abuse on the tires. Update 1-5-2016: I drove the car today, and the FM Radio works great now! "

    "title": "Missouri Safety inspection exhaust hole, fail",
    "body": "2015/11/21 - Follow up to the failed emissions and safety test earlier this week.  Last night I got under the car again and checked for leaks, found that one of the gaskets I hadn’t touched was leaking, so I tried to cover that up with some exhaust tape. I also wrapped some of the tape around the hole in the pipe, then let the car run for 20 minutes at idle to try to get it to set in. I swapped the wheels on the car to run the tires with good tread on them, and headed off to Washington Missouri to put some miles on the car to try to get the computer set with proper responses for the emissions code tests. While in Washington Missouri I managed to draft the exhaust over two bumps, figuring out how the hole got in the pipe to begin with (this was the first time I had bottomed out with it). I stopped in at the local Wal-Mart (the only thing open at 10pm in Washington, MO) to see if I could get any more exhaust tape, figuring I had torn the existing tape. Low and behold, WM didn’t have anything I could use, so I headed back out to the parking lot, started up the car and reached underneath to see if it was leaking. Fortunately it didn’t appear to be dumping any exhaust out from where it was leaking, so I thought I was okay. I figured out that my SLIP light that keeps coming on is not related to my wheel bearing, it must be that I mistakenly tore the clock spring when I was trying to fix the horn/airbag earlier this week. So that’ll likely mean that I need to replace that again, but we’ll deal with that down the road, I don’t need it for the inspections. This morning I took the car back to Dobbs to get the safety and emissions inspections done. Good news is that the car passed the emissions check! The bad news is that apparently exhaust repairs need to be welds, not tape… So, next weekend I’ll head down to Solo Performance Specialtiesâ€‹ and weld something onto the pipe to close up the exhaust. This winter I will replace the exhaust entirely, but for now I just need to pass the darn safety inspection. "

    "title": "350z and Missouri Safety and Emissions tests",
    "body": "2015/11/21 - The car failed Missouri safety and emissions testing today. When I pulled out of the driveway this morning something happened up front, on the brakes, one of the wheels locked up, “SLIP” and “VDC” lights came on and wouldn’t shut off. Restarted the car, got out, checked for anything noticeable and drove down the road to the gas station. At the station I decided to plug the OBDII scanner in and sure enough, it was throwing an ABS code. Told it to clear all codes to see if that would stay off, but after driving a short time the two lights came back on. Crap. Went to the local Dobbs, and put it in for testing. They said the ABS light wouldn’t be a concern for the testing, and the horn I wired up to a button was sufficient. What I forgot was the tires need to have decent tread for the safety inspection, over the weekend I threw the Hankook RS3s on as one of the RE-71s was flat, that was a mistake. The RS3s have hardly any tread, and failed inspection. I’ll throw the RE71s back on tomorrow night and just watch the one that is leaking air (this Dobbs plugged a whole in it 2 weeks ago). The noise this morning in the driveway was likely the left front wheel bearing, throwing the ABS off. That also failed inspection, so I replaced the wheel bearing tonight. Also failed for a couple of exhaust issues, 3 of the 6 (8?) gaskets on the exhaust were leaking, so I replaced them with 3 gaskets I was able to obtain from Autozone. Not perfect fits, but hopefully close enough, added some high temp sealant in there as well to try to fix the leaks there. There’s also a hole in the exhaust pipe on the passenger side, where it dips down lower than the driver’s side, it has apparently scraped over many a speed bump and torn through. I put some sealant in there tonight, and will put some exhaust repair tape over it tomorrow night (after the sealant sets) to see if I can close that up for the inspection. This winter that damn exhaust is coming off in favor of something lighter. Finally, they couldn’t even do the emissions testing, because me resetting the codes to try to fix the ABS also cleared all the emissions sensors, so I have to drive the car for a while (how far?) after I get all the exhaust repairs done to try and get the sensors enough mileage to run through their data and hopefully be able to get the car back in for inspection on Friday morning. https://www. instagram. com/p/-P8sroOuJ3/?taken-by=thechristoc "

    "title": "Washing, Waxing and then Cleaning 350z Headlights",
    "body": "2015/11/16 - This weekend, being what is likely the last warm weekend of 2015, I decided it was time to wash/claybar/wax the 350z. The weather was beautiful, I spent most of Saturday afternoon performing the first two steps, washing and clay bar’ng the car. The car was pretty clean, but there were some decent cone marks/residue on the side skirts from the previous owner, most of the time spent with the clay bar was there, though there were various other locations on the car that needed attention as well. Clay Bar basics: If you’ve never taken a clay bar to the paint on your car, here’s a quick primer. A clay bar is used to clean up particulates in paint and to remove wax, and if you autocross, it is rather useful for cleaning up cone marks. The first thing you need to do before using the bar is to Wash the car. Drying the car isn’t really necessary as you will be washing it again after you finish with the bar. Once you’ve watched the car, you can use a lubricant (detailer mist/spray) to work the clay bar over small sections of the car. You will notice that as you run the bar over the car you will feel the paint smooth out, this happens when the bar picks up the crap from the paint. Be careful not to drop the clay bar on the ground, if you do this it will be covered in grit and crap that you definitely don’t want to rub back into the paint of the car. Once you’ve finished one spot, move on to the next. I ended up not using detailer spray yesterday and just used soapy water, then rinsed that water/soap off with hose every few minutes. If you find trouble spots, scratches, imperfections, it is worth trying to run the clay bar over these spots, sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes of work, but often times it will clean up with enough effort, this is especially true of cone marks on the bottom portion of side skirts. After finishing with the clay bar you’re going to want to wash your vehicle again to get any residue that remains from the clay bar and the detailer spray off the car. I dried the car with a California car squeegee, and then my shammy. I took the blower and tried to get any remaining water out of the seams of the car and then parked it in the garage for a couple of hours to let it fully dry. Last night I then applied a coat of polish before turning in for the night. This morning I woke up early and put a coat of wax on the car, and decided it was time to clean the headlights up. Cleaning 350z Headlights: The headlights on my car were in two different states, the passenger side headlight has some stress cracks, but the surface plastic only had a very faint fog to it. I was able to clean this fog off with a simple headlight restoration polish that I’ve had for a few years, it was simple, rub it on, wipe it off, good as new (minus the cracks). The driver’s side headlight however was not in near as nice a shape, it appeared to have over spray on it, as well as scuffs likely from a sanding process when the car was painted at some point. The headlight polish I used on the passenger side, didn’t do a lick of good on the driver’s side. For this I chose to go with “Meguiar’s G2000 Perfect Clarity Two Step Headlight Restoration Kit”, this kit comes with an abrasive pad (2x), a rubbing compound (step 1), and a clear coat spray (step 2). Step 1) Don’t be afraid here, but you are going to scratch the crap out of your headlight lens, step 2 will make this better. I had to spend a good 15-20 minutes working on the driver’s side lens due to the scuffing and fogging on the plastic. The abrasive pad and the polishing compound should be used in one direction, not in a swirling motion. I wiped the product off every couple of minutes to try to check my progress, when you are done with this you will need to use a wet rag to wipe the residue off. One thing I did for this, due to the abrasive nature of the product, I taped over the paint with blue painters tape, to protect the paint around the headlamp from scratches. When I do this again on another vehicle, I would actually use tape and newspaper to cover a larger area (due to step 2). Step 2) The instructions for the product don’t tell you much about this, but Step 2 is a spray can of clear coat that will restore the gloss and shine to your headlamps. Be sure to tape off the area around the lamp if you haven’t done this already for Step 1. Basically you spray the clear coat on in two separate applications, waiting 3-5 minutes for the first coat to dry. I must admit, I was not thrilled about scratching up the headlights even more to use this kit, but the end results was most definitely worth it! "

    "body": "2015/11/07 - Earlier this week, Dave from SoloPerformance. com and I headed down to Chattanooga to pick up Project350z V3. A 2003 Nissan 350z Touring model, with 145k miles on the clock. The car was purchased from a fellow autocrosser, and is primarily prepped for SCCA’s STU class. The car has a couple of issues, the first one I need to address is that the horn doesn’t work. After digging into it, I found it is because it simply isn’t wired up, a previous owner had replaced the stock wheel, and when the owner I purchased it from got it, he put the original stock wheel back on. The wiring was jacked at this point, and the cruise control and horn no longer connect/work. I’ve already placed an order for some parts to hopefully get those two items addressed this coming week so I can get it out for Missouri inspection so I can get it tagged. I’ll be doing some modifications over the winter to get it in line with the STU rules, and hopefully fully prepped to give it a competitive chance for 2016. This Sunday (11/8) I’ll have the car out and running at the final Gateway Autocross Association event for 2015, see you out there! Stay tuned as I dig into the car and get to actively blogging more as I get the work done on the car. "

    "body": "2015/09/06 - So the time has come, I am currently car shopping again. I’ve been threatening it for a while now, but with the 2015 Solo National Championships going on this week, and a few other life things figured out, it is time to make the 2016 autocross season happen! So a few details. I’m once again looking at early 350z’s, this time around I’m not looking for a daily driver, this next car will be built specifically for autocross and a fun weekend toy, with some daily driving here and there (thankful I have a short commute). I am looking for the perfect car, how do you define that? Well, in an ideal world the perfect 350z for me would be:  Year: 2003, 2004, 2005 Model: Base, Enthusiast. Preference would be Base, the lightest of the 350z’s.  Mileage: &lt;100k, though I think this is going to be the one I have to be the most flexible on.  Transmission: Manual (not optional) Mods: NoneWhy 2003, 2004, 2005?: The primary reason is the price, I am looking to get something cheap, I would like to spend between $5k and $7k. The other reason is that the weight of the later cars went up a bit as safety equipment was added (standard side curtain airbags, etc). I also had both a 2003 and 2004 before, so some of the motivation is nostalgia. Why a Base or Enthusiast Model?: The Base and Enthusiast models are the lightest of the models. The Enthusiast model has Traction Control, HID Headlights, and a Limited Slip Differential (LSD), options that the BASE model doesn’t have. Both of my previous cars were Enthusiasts, though my preference this time around would be a base model. While I like the HID headlamps, I definitely don’t need them on a primarily autocrossed car, and the TCS on the prior to cars was turned off every time I started the car up, so I would prefer not to have it this time around. As for the LSD, the one provided in the 350zs was a horrible device, so I would be replacing it with something better this time around. So at this time, a BASE model is my preferred option. Mods?: You might think, Chris, if you’re going to prep the car for autocross, why do you want one without mods? A couple of reasons:  An unmodded car, is more likely (but not always) to be unmolested, not as abused Mods in Autocross change classes on a car, I want to be able to control where the car goes, without having to take it completely apart to see if there are mods I don’t know about and would be illegal in whichever class I choose to build the car for. 2005 Base Model 350z: I looked at a 2005 Base model 350z today, here are my comments on that car. If the owner of that car happens to stumble on this, please take no offense, this is just my analysis of the car for the purposes of assisting anyone else looking to purchase a 350z for autocross purposes. The car I looked at today was silver, pretty obviously repainted at some point as the front end looked pretty good for a car with 150k miles on it. That being said there were plenty of issues to be found with the car, here’s a quick rundown, along with my thoughts on each. From the original post, the owner said the car was stock, but inspection of the pictures on Craigslist showed otherwise. Initially I noticed that the tail lights had been replaced, the intake replaced, and the wheels replaced, further inspection of the car found other things as well.  Bumper cover â€“ this car had obviously had some front end damage, nothing that I could see in the frame, but the bumper cover was literally ripped/separated from the top right portion of the car.  Plastic undertray â€“ the undertray under the motor/front end was nowhere to be found. I know you can purchase this, as I replaced the one on my first 350z, but replacing the one on this car might have been an issue as the tabs where most of the screws would go into on the bumper cover were broken or missing.  CAI â€“ this car had some form of a cold air induction system, though I couldn’t find a brand on it. The filter attached to it was caked in dirt and grease.  Plenum spacer â€“ As I found on my 2004 350z after purchasing it, this car appeared to have a spacer of some sort installed as well.  Driver’s seat â€“ As common on the 350zs, the side bolster on this car was worn through to the foam. Honestly this isn’t a huge deal as I would be replacing the seat(s) with a more race oriented seat anyways.  Driver’s side carpet â€“ the driver’s side carpet was worn through, and the owner had some big bulky rubber floor mat in there to cover it up. The base models I believe originally didn’t come with floor mats, it is a shame someone didn’t put one in this car early on to prevent this.  Dirt everywhere, so much dirt TPS Monitors and tires â€“ the car was equipped with 18” Performance wheels, with 225 tires on them. There were no TPS sensors, the tires were far too narrow on the wheels, plus they would need to be replaced, they were crap tires.  Spare tire â€“ the spare was still in the car, though it was not attached to the car as it should have been, the screw for that was nowhere to be found, and the jack/tools to change the spare were either missing, or misplaced.  Spare tire well â€“ The inside of the spare tire well on this car had either oil, or water in it. He claimed it was spilled oil, it sure felt like water. Either way, there is nothing that should be in there besides a spare tire, how does water get in there?The biggest deal: So after listing off all the things wrong with the car, I do keep in mind that it is a 10 year old car, with 150k miles on it. I gladly would have purchased the car and turned it into an autocross beast, but we simply were too far off on the price. The car itself according to KBB and Edmunds is worth at most $5500, which is what I told him I would be willing to pay in cash. He wanted $8750 as he says he has a loan on it (he posted it again on Craigslist after I left at $8500). Honestly after writing this up, if he were to reach back out to me, I would probably drop my offer a bit, Edmunds says dealer retail on the car is like $4k. What comes next?: At this point I don’t know when I will purchase my next 350z. I hope to find something this fall, we have one more Gateway Autocross Association event later this year, I would love to run my own car for that, but that might not be possible. "

A couple of months ago I actually tried to remove the arms on my car so I could lube them up and try to get rid of some of the excess noise in the car, but I wasn’t able to. One of the nuts on the upper strut mount was stuck and no matter what I tried I wasn’t able to get the nut removed. I picked up some tools from the local Ace Hardware in Half Moon Bay to get that pesky nut off, and this morning when I got started, things didn’t go well. I managed to break an extension I was trying to use, then I managed to break the bolt extractor as well! I was not a happy camper, though I decided to try one more thing, a better quality extension and turning it by hand. After that nut was removed replacing the control arms was nice and easy. So the first parts of the car are back to stock, I’m shipping out Mike’s new control arms early next week, and hopefully they will see some autocross action soon! "

Wheels are in okay shape, couple nicks here or there, no curb rash, see pictures (larger versions on Flickr). These are autocross wheels/tires and have been treated as such. After looking at the pics, I probably should have at least washed them. . Contact 350z @ christoc. com for info Click on photos for a Larger View     On car "

    "body": "2011/10/31 - Today was the first event in the San Francisco Region’s slush series. I decided to head out and try to dust some of the rust off, and last night decided to build a camera mount for the car. After seeing the GoPro HD Hero2 launch video, I decided it was time to try to start getting more interesting video. Earlier this week I attempted to do something interesting with video on my bicycle for https://www. bicycletips. com but the video turned out pretty bad. For the 350z I wanted to try to get the camera up and behind the car. Not just on top of the car, but a couple feet back and above the car. So I got the building, really I didn’t build much, just assembled some parts that I had, and that I picked up from the local Ace Hardware store here in Half Moon Bay. This is the end result I won’t bother posting all the parts of what this contains, not yet, as it is just V1, and you will see from the video below that it actually doesn’t work that well. That is video of my 4th run today. I had cone issues all day long, and the fourth run was no exception, but that’s not the real focus of this post, the video. The video, blah, it really didn’t turn out well. The camera has two major flaws. One the way I mounted it into the extension wasn’t secure enough, so it had slight movement, which I think is the majority of the noise you hear, though some of that could actually be from the safety strap that I had all this tied to the car with. The other flaw was the amount of movement on the camera/poll itself. I don’t think there’s a good way to get rid of that without doing some sort of guide cable setup, which I hope to try out in the next couple of weeks. I do like the angle that the view that the video shows, makes for an interesting angle for sure. What do you think? Besides the shakyness and the bad audio, what do you think of the setup? "

    "body": "2011/07/23 - So the time finally came, or I finally got around to it, the hitch is now on our 2004 Nissan 350z. The hitch is a Curt Hitch for the 350z, available via Amazon. I purchased it quite a while ago, but haven’t taken the time to get the car apart and install it. Today that all changed. To get the hitch on the car, you first have to remove the rear bumper fascia from the car, that’s fairly simple to do, remove the rear tail lights, remove 6 or so screws, 4 clips, and pull. The 350z Service Manual is helpful for this. After that you have to go ahead and drill some holes in the bumper. The hitch itself uses 4 bolts, but the instructions call for cutting a fifth hole, to access to make fishing in the bolts and washer plates. We spent quite a bit of time trying to avoid cutting the access hole, trust me, just cut it, don’t go through the pain of trying to make it work without. I also recommend that you get a long magnetic puller tool, something that extends like an old conference room pointer, with a magnet on the end, it will make things easier to access within the aluminum bumper of the 350z. Other helpful steps, get a couple of extra washers, there is no way, in my opinion, that the Curt Hitch can work with the two washers included, you need at least 4 (we got 6 extra, used 4 total). Part of the biggest pain in doing the installation of the Hitch were the two clips that hold the bumper fascia on just outside/below the tail lights. They are hard to access due to the layout of the car, I was able to finally get them off using an 8mm wrench, though it took a lot of cursing. Installation of these was even worse, here’s my advice. Take the clips out of the body of the car, put them onto the fascia, then put them back into the car when the bumper goes back on. Be careful not to break them. So the hitch is on the car, though I don’t plan to use it for a good couple of weeks at least. I don’t have a trailer yet, it will likely just be used so that I can take a bike to/from work so I can ride at lunch. Here is a during, and after photo, and stay tuned for the time lapse video of the process later on.  "

The trip was nice and uneventful, traffic was great, but I’m sure that had to do with the fact that it was so early on a Sunday morning of a three day weekend. I got out to the event, registered, and signed up for my work assignment, then began the dirty work. Changing the tires on the car. It’s a fairly painless job, though I really drag it out most times, I could probably get it done in under 5 minutes, but typically it takes me 15-20 as I fart around doing it. I worked first heat, I was doing the timer cards, wow, I can’t tell you the last time I had to write times down instead of them going into a computer I little antiquated, but the process over all worked out. Computers can definitely make things more efficient, but also add a level of overhead that most clubs don’t want to deal with. The weather at Marina was awesome today, I was half prepared to freeze my ass off because Ed Runnion warned me last night to bring a jacket. I must admit, a jacket, or pants, were not needed today! A t-shirt and shorts were plenty. I ran in the second heat, my first autox runs since the El Toro ProSolo in April. I was definitely rusty. I also seemed to have forgotten how badly this car needs a differential. If anyone from OS Giken is out there and interested in trading some sponsorship for product let me know, I’m definitely open to opportunities My runs for the most part improved each time today, until the last I believe. I don’t know where my times were compared to much of the rest of the class, but I know I was probably 1. 5+ seconds off where I should have been. The ASP cars I saw were running low 41s, while I was in the low 43s. The Tsang brothers (FSP) were in the high 42s, so I definitely need to get this car sorted out and my driving improved! I didn’t stick around the site after my runs, changed tires and headed out so that I could get home. I think I found the downfall of living in Half Moon Bay. It took me just under 2 hours to get to Marina this morning, and over 3 hours to get home due to all the holiday/beach traffic! Here’s a photo I took of the car today I didn’t take many photos, but you can see the few that I did here. I’ll have videos up later this week Settings:  Tire psi: 25/23 f/r Shocks: Front 7 clicks compression 1 full turn rebound Rear 3 clicks rebound"

Then last month we moved again, this time only 20 miles or so away, but I figured I would find the helmet if it were still around during that move. I was wrong. I found nothing. Until today, Natalie was going through boxes of pictures with her mother (visiting for the weekend) and in one of the boxes labeled Picture Frames, she found the helmet! Earlier this year I purchased a new helmet (pictured) getting ready for the 2011 autocross season, while I like the helmet, it wasn’t my Bell, which I always hoped would return. I’ll have to take a picture of the Bell later this weekend, I can’t find one digging through old photos, but I did come across some photos from the day I picked up my 2003 350z.

Not exactly the best choice, but hey, I was in the heat of the moment thinking I was prepping the car for a fully competitive 2011 season. That has changed, (more on that later). A couple of weeks ago I told the subwoofer and amplifier for the car, I wasn’t interested in putting all of that weight back in anyways. So tonight after work I put the speakers back in the door (with some cutting and soldering on the OEM wiring due to not having adapters for it. I managed to get everything back into the front of the car, including the crossovers, and the head unit. I wasn’t able to get the radio working, as it doesn’t seem to see that the Antenna is hooked up, so I’ll have to track that down. I also didn’t get the rear speakers in, simply due to time/darkness, I’ll get those later this week. So, why am I not building the car fully for 2011? Well honestly, budget. I need to put quite a bit more money into the car, and it’s already the middle of June. Where did time go? So, without the budget to fully prep the car, I’m going to drive something else at the 2011 Solo Nationals. I’ll be driving Dave Whitworth’s Mustang in EM at Nationals. Dave and I have been friends for 11 years now, he was my first instructor when I started autocrossing, and while I surpassed him in autocross skills long ago, he’s still a friend of mine. (Update 8/16/2024: I’m driving with Dave again this year, and I’ve yet to beat him…. ) I’ll fly into Lincoln, though I’m not sure when yet, and likely be there all week. I’ve offered to announce at the ProSolo Finale, though I haven’t heard if anyone is interested in taking me up on that offer or not. I am hoping that for 2012 I can get the 350z sorted out and ready for Nationals. Though, I really don’t like that I now live 26 hours from Nationals.

I can’t exactly put Natalie and the baby in the 350z and make the drive, and making the drive with the 350z, towing a trailer for tires, and having Natalie and the baby drive in the CX-7 isn’t ideal either. So I have a couple of options.  Don’t go (least expensive option, also least fun) Drive myself in the 350z, have Natalie and baby fly out (requires airline ticket, and rental car) Drive myself in the 350z and have Natalie and baby stay home Fly to Lincoln and codrive with someone elseWhat to do, what to do?

This weekend there’s the Dual at DeAnza, last year I was hoping to run this year’s event, but due to everything going on I ended up not registering. It looks like Grant (ShamuZ) has lost his car for the event, due to losing a rear diff (He’s got an OS Giken diff as far as I know, I need to find out what happened as that is the diff I was hoping to put in my car later this year). I’ve asked Grant to see if he can get me into his entry position for the Duel, if he can I will try to run the event. If it doesn’t work out, so be it, but I think it would be cool to run.

Why am I wrapping the car? Because I can? Or well, because I want to. I don’t know yet that I can. I’ve applied quite a bit of vinyl in my life, but never to an entire car. Why not have someone else wrap it? Why not have a designer wrap done? Both of those options cost money, and I really would rather spend money elsewhere on the car.

Car Class: BSPSuspension ConfigurationFront: TrueChoice Coilovers (bump 1 full turn, rebound 6 clicks) 650lb SpringsRear: Koni Sports (rebound 2. 5 clicks) 500lb Springs on Adjustable PerchesHotchkis Sway Bars: Front Full Stiff (Front hole of 3) Rear Medium Stiffness (Middle hole of 3) Day 1, Run 1 time: 56. 744 I started off with a very slick feeling car, cold tires. Overall, the run was okay, but I felt like I was braking too much (only slight taps) and I should have been a lot faster. I was all over the rev limiter multiple times, I think I briefly shifted to third, but should have done it earlier and for far longer. Tire Pressures: Front 25, Rear 23 Day 1, Run 2 time: 60. 545 On my second run on Saturday, I went out with the idea that I wasn’t going to hit the rev limiter; I was going to shift to third at the top of the hill and run down the hill in third. This worked out well, until right before the final slalom when I was carrying too much speed and the rear of the car came out from under me. I came to a sliding stop and continued on the course to a time of 60. 5 Day 1, Run 3 time: 55:684+2 My third and final run, I started off and blew the corner just after the first slalom, this got me stirred up so I decided to really try and push it on this run. Well, I pushed it, pushed it hard enough to hit two cones in the middle of the very last slalom. I knew I hit one, didn’t realize the second one. Would have been a decent time (compared to my other times) had I not hit those pesky cones. Day 2, Run 1 time: DNF So I was fortunate enough to announce the San Diego Tour; I was announcing the first heat. On Sunday morning, a number of people were DNF’ing at corner 3 on their runs. I thought, how the heck are these people DNF’ing. At one point three mod cars (the only three in the heat) DNF’d on 3 consecutive runs. Well, on my first run I figured it out. At the top of the hill right before the sharp right-hand turn, there was an element you had to set up to the left of. I realized this right when I was passing by on the right. I ended up slamming the brakes but had no way to get over, so I floored it and kept going. I managed a decent time, 51 something I believe, but it really didn’t matter with the DNF Day 2, Run 2 time: 51. 302+1 On run 2 I went out and tried to throw down a good time, I was pretty frustrated with myself that I had DNF’d the first run. Well right before the finish, I managed to clip a cone, throwing this run out the window as well. After this run, I was sitting in 8th or 9th in BSP. Day 2, Run 3 time: 51. 020 Finally, a run I could be happy with, the first one all weekend. This run ended up putting me into 6th place in BSP and 1st in our own little ZSP class we had going internally in BSP. "

I was actually sitting there thinking, why do I do this? I really was thinking, I love seeing friends and talking to everyone, but I was pretty down on the racing part of things. While I was announcing first heat a number of cars were DNF’ng corner 3, all the MOD cars dnf’d their first run. I thought, what is wrong with these people, why are they dnf’ng up there? Well, on my first run I found out, as I did the same damn thing. I was flying around the top of the course, looking ahead (or so I though) and all of a sudden I realized I wasn’t anywhere close to making it where I needed to be, I slammed on the brakes then decided there was no way I was going to make it so I hit the gas and drove on. My second run started off okay, but coming in to the end I clipped a cone, I knew it, wasn’t one I should of hit, but did. So I was sitting in 8th or 9th as of that run, where I started the day in 7th. My 3rd run I wasn’t really happy going into, I was sitting in 3rd place in ZSP (our little Z car competition with 4 drivers). I went out and did as well as I could. I put up the lowest Z time for the day and moved into first in ZSP and 6th in BSP. Had I not had issues yesterday I truly believe I could have taken 5th for the weekend (1 out of trophies) but I still would have been 4 or 5 seconds out of first.

First heat, they got an extra run/look at the course due to some unforeseen issues with the surface, the course got changed, and the event started over 1hr into the day. Good deal for them, not so much for those who were working. Fortunately I was just walking around talking on the mic. I ran third heat, first run went out and the car did okay, I was sitting in 2nd place after first drivers in BSP. After all drivers went I was in 4th (final trophy spot). I was all over the rev limiter in 2nd on the run, hitting the limit MULTIPLE times MULTIPLE times on the course. From there it went downhill. 2nd run I decided to shift to 3rd and left it in third for a long time. That actually played out well (I think, I’m hoping to look at the data tonight and see if it was faster), up until right before the finish slalom, in which I lost control of the car and spun out. My third run started off bad, missing a turn, braking when I didn’t need to be. I shifted to third around the same place and ran downhill fast. I downshifted right before the final slalom and made it into the slalom without spinning, but I managed to take out the first two cones. I wasn’t to thrilled with the run, but my raw time was over a second faster than the first, knowing how bad I screwed up a few places I was happy with the result. After day 1 I’m sitting in 7th in BSP, and more importantly in 2nd in ZSP (we’re running our own mini class of Nissan’s in BSP). I plan to catch Grant tomorrow though, look out Gman!

This morning I took part in the Evolution School advantage program, basically you get a ton of seat time in the morning before the practice course opens up for the rest of the entrants for the National Tour. My r-comps were on a truck on the way to the tour, so I ran my street tires for the morning session. I also had the car set at full soft (bump/rebound), most definitely not the configuration needed, and my evo instructor Brian let me know. He knew me (not to be cocky, a lot of autocrossers do because of my involvement with SCCAForums. com and announcing at events throughout the years), but he made the mistake of assuming I knew what I was doing ðŸ˜®. He assumed I knew about suspension setup, I corrected him, and asked for help! He was very helpful and provided me some guidance to try things out. In the morning sessions on street tires (Azenis 615s, decent tires) I got down to 30. 0, not bad, but nothing near the 27. that a SS Z06 was running. I also had a horrendous knocking coming from the front end of the car, though that wasn’t new, it was happening all week. When I put the new bushings in I failed to apply any grease to them (other than when they went into the control arms). My father is here in town to watch me run at the tour, so we headed over to autozone to get some white lithium spray grease to try to help with the knocking. I thought, there was no way that it would help, but geez, it’s amazing how much quieter the car is now. When the tires showed up I got them put on and adjusted the Konis a bit, then went back out and ran a few more practice runs to see how the car felt. I got faster on each run, finishing with a 28. 555. Still not up to snuff against that Z06, but definitely better than I had been doing in the morning. I ended up going with the following settings on the Konis: Front Double Adjustable Truechoice Coilovers Rebound: 1 full turn from soft (2. 5 turns is full stiff) Bump: 6 clicks (12 or 13 clicks is full stiff) Rear Koni Sports (single adjustable) Rebound: 2. 5 clicks (10 clicks available) I’m still trying to get the time lapse video from drive down to San Diego yesterday together.

So today I took the car to the local Firestone dealer to get an alignment done today. Here’s what I told them. â€œI want to know what the specs are, and I want the toe to be within factory specifications. ” No problem they said, then they upsold me on the lifetime alignment.

Well, I dropped the car a bit. I wasn’t too happy with how little the car dropped after the work this week, so today I spent some time adjusting the suspension a bit. I’ve never worked with coil overs or spring perches before so it took a little bit of figuring things out. I ended up bringing the car down a bit. Here is the photo from yesterday: and what it looks like today (with the race tires on).  I drove around the neighborhood a bit with the race tires on to see if I had any trouble rubbing, in the current configuration it doesn’t look to. The wheels are 18x10 +38 Enkei RPF1s, and the tires are 305 V710s. I’m glad there doesn’t appear to be any rubbing issues, we’ll see how it goes under autocross competition though.

Thankfully, Ed is going to haul the wheels/tires down to San Diego for the National Tour next weekend, and the El Toro the following weekend.

I may have cut a little too deep into the control armâ€¦ bah! I may have to go ahead and order another OEM replacement arm just to be safe. Fortunately, the cut doesn’t go across the whole arm, but we’ll see. I would hate to think what could happen if that arm broke while I was driving down the highway.

Unfortunately the didn’t think he was going to be able to press them out due to the way the oem bushings are shaped. I ended up coming home and going back to the approach that John from BetaMotorsports suggested earlier in the day on a forum.  Burn out the rubber part of the stock bushings and push the center out.  Take the blade of your hacksaw and thread it through the bushing opening.  Reassemble the hacksaw and cut one or two slits in the steel outer bushing shell.  Using a chisel, carefully curl the cut corners of the steel outer shell into the center.  At some point you should be able to push the shell out. So tonight I came home and completed step 1 on all 4 of the bushings (I had one done yesterday). Unfortunately I don’t have a hack saw! Tried to stop by Ace Hardware on the way home, but they were closed. So I’ll head somewhere tomorrow and grab one and hopefully get through steps 2-5. I doubt I’ll have the car back on the road tomorrow night, but hopefully I can get it done Wednesday.

I’ll do a full write-up with photos and what to do, where, etc. , later this week, but for now let’s talk about what went wrong! The rear of the car was great, only a couple of minor issues. The first issue was that one of the rear shocks didn’t have the nut that came with the original Konis so that the upper mount could attach. Not a huge deal as I had a spare nut to use. Then when I went to put it on the car I found out that I was missing two other nuts, for the lower mount/bolt. I didn’t have anything for those so I had to run to Ace Hardware to pick something up. I also got some anti-seize because I remember how much of a pain the lower bolt was on my old 350z, so much that I left the shocks on it when I sold it because I couldn’t get them off. Not a huge deal like I said, I got the rear squared away.  The fronts however were a different story. Everything came off easily, even the OEM control arms. I quickly realized that I wasn’t going to be able to get the bushings out though, I was going to need to have them pressed out. Not a huge deal, I could put the other control arms on, the SPL arms that I got with all the suspension. I wasn’t planning on using the SPL arms, because they aren’t legal for the class I am running in Autocross, but I could put them on for a few days while I finished up the OEM arms and custom bushings. I did try to burn the bushings out, and while I caused a mess and got some nice burning rubber fumes floating around the garage, I didn’t get very far. Here’s a photo of the before and after: Before  After  So I started to put things together, the front coilovers back on, and I started to bolt them in place. Problem. The TrueChoice Koni coilovers unfortunately don’t use the same bolt as the stock struts did. And guess what? I didn’t have anything that would work. I ended up driving around town for 2 hours this afternoon trying to find a bolt that would work. I found something, but it was class 8. 8, which from my reading is equivalent to grade 5. Most likely not strong enough, but I went ahead and tried to use them anyway. Then, next thing. I put this bolt in place, and then started to attach the upper control arm back in place. That’s when I ran into the next problem. The SPL arm’s ball joint uses a different size bolt than the OEM ball joints, so here I am again, without the parts needed to put the car back together. I ended up getting the car rollable so I could get it entirely into the garage, then put it back up on jack stands in the front, then removed the other OEM control arm. I’m going to have Natalie take me to work tomorrow, and hopefully, I can get the control arm bushings pressed out so that I can get the car back together tomorrow or Tuesday evening. I also need to order new bolts for the front struts. (m12 1. 75 70mm should work) I have a lot of photos from today posted on the Suspension Flickr Set. And of course, here’s the time lapse! "

I on the other hand am game (at least I hope). I’ll be installing everything this Saturday, it’ll be a long day, but hopefully I can get everything installed.

    "body": "2011/03/10 - My birthday gift (early) from my wife showed up today (I have the best wife ever!), a new suspension (well new to me) for the 350z. There’s only one problem (and not her fault, as I ordered it) the control arms that came aren’t legal for the class the car is being built for. The problem with them is that the arms use spherical bearings in place of bushings, and the BSP rules read  15. 8. C. Suspension bushings may be replaced with bushings of any materials   (except metal) as long as they fit in the original location. Offset    bushings may be used. In a replacement bushing the amount    of metal relative to the amount of non-metallic material may not be     increased. This does not authorize a change in type of bushing (for    example ball and socket replacing a cylindrical bushing), or use of    a bushing with an angled hole whose direction differs from that of    the original bushing. If the Stock bushing accommodated multi-axis    motion via compliance of the component material(s), the replacement    bushing may not be changed to accommodate such motion    via change in bushing type, for example to a spherical bearing or    similar component involving internal moving parts. Pins or keys may    be used to prevent the rotation of alternate bushings, but may serve    no other purpose than that of retaining the bushing in the desired    position. Differential mount bushings are not considered to be suspension    bushings and are not covered by this allowance. Here’s what the arms look like, pretty sweet! I’ve emailed the manufacturer to see if they make another option for the bushing, I don’t expect that they do, but we will see. From there I will have to see if I can get something fabricated, or may have to go with another manufacturer’s part.  Here are some of the other suspension parts that came today. TrueChoice Phase 4 Double Adjustable Koni coil overs for the front of the car with 650lb springs For the rear of the car, 500lb springs with adjustable spring seats, and regular off the shelf Koni Sport shocks.    I had hoped to install all of this on the car this weekend, but I may hold off until I can get the proper camber adjustment in place. As soon as I bring the car down I’m going to have to get an alignment done and likely roll the fenders to get the race tires to fit underneath, but we’ll see for sure on that last part when I get it dropped.

I was pleased with my runs, my time being faster than a few cars I was sick of being beat by (ST civics!). Though when I went to check the results I was in 6th out of 7 in the Index class I run. I run Index, not in the standard BSP class at SCCA events because I want to compete against the fastest of the fast, no offense to the regular BSP competitors. 6th of 7, eh, at least I wasn’t DFL.

Woot! happy dance I believe the first heat of the day had a drying course, and the event overall was smaller (122 drivers) but I’ll gladly take a 10th on overall index any day here in the Bay Area!

For those of you who don’t know, I had a problem with my GoPro camera, which I use a LOT! I use it for autocross videos, and time lapse videos of working on the car. A few weeks ago I was working on the car doing a standard time lapse, but the camera freaked out. I came to find out that there was a bug in the camera software that would show up with time lapse mode after 10k (I think) photos were taken. It was a known bug though, and there was a firmware update for the camera to fix the bug. So I applied the firmware update, but something during the process failed and the camera ended up â€œbricking” which basically means it wouldn’t work. You couldn’t power it on, you couldn’t use it, nothing, it was as useful as a brick. Since I got the camera for xmas it was still under warranty so I contacted GoPro about getting it fixed, while it took a bit of back and forth via email with their customer service reps, they provided me with an RMA number to send it in. This was a couple of weeks ago, right before a 2 day autocross and right before we were heading out of town for vacation, so I didn’t get the camera mailed out until Tuesday of this week. On Thursday I got an email from them saying that they had a replacement camera ready to mail out, but I hadn’t included a return address. I replied with our address, and then on Friday I got an email saying it would go out. It is nice that we live about 15 miles from their headquarters because the camera showed up today via USPS. I’m not positive that the firmware fix has been applied to this camera yet, but I’m going to leave it as is for now. I want to use it at the autocross tomorrow, so I don’t want to run the risk of bricking it again! "

    "title": "350z Traction Control and Square Tires",
    "body": "2011/03/02 - So I experienced something while driving the 350z yesterday that I haven’t experienced in quite a while. Typically the 350z comes with a staggered tire setup, meaning that the front tires are usually a smaller size than the rears. A week or two ago I got some new street tires put on the car, the new tires are â€œsquare” meaning the fronts are the same size as the rear. This actually gives you the ability to rotate the wheels/tires (assuming the wheels are the same size), which can go a long way in making your tires last longer. The old set I had taken off were actually okay in the front, but the rears were bald, being able to rotate could have helped prevent that. The downfall of having a square setup, at least with a 350z, is that the computer isn’t setup for that, not having the stagger causes the front tires to run at a different speed in relation to the rear tires. This causes the computer to freak out, though most of the time it is fine, where it will freak out is typically when you are accelerating on an onramp. I had this happen for the first time since some time in 2006 (when I sold my first 350z) last night. It wasn’t a huge shocker, but it was a bit of a surprise. You can avoid the computer issue, but it requires turning off the traction control, something you can’t do when it is activated by the differing speeds. So for now, I will continue to turn off the traction control (tcs) when I get in the car. I’m curious to see if there are any ways to disable the TCS by default, and only have it turn on when you press the button. That would be extremely useful in autocross as you NEVER want traction control in a 350z enabled when autocrossing. "

    "body": "2011/02/21 - So there’s been much debate (or really just many people telling me I am crazy) over on SCCAForums in the thread I started to discuss the proposed move of the 350z from BSP to ESP in SCCA Autocross classing. Ever since the 350z was released I thought it was the perfect F-Stock car, though others have always seemed to think otherwise and it was relegated to B-Stock where all but a few events it became an also ran behind the RX-8. It was also classed in BSP (b street prepared) where it hasn’t faired any better for the last 8 years. Last month the SCCA posted a proposal to move the 350z from BSP to ESP, I’m all for the move, most of the ESP folk apparently aren’t, “A Japanese car in our American Car Class? How dare you!” Alright, so no one has made that complaint, but the way they “defend” their ground they might as well be drawing lines in the soil. There’s much debate about what a 350z will actually weight in SP trim, my car isn’t fully SP prepped yet (and to be honest that will likely take 2-3 years due to budget) but I figured I would go ahead and weigh the car at the divisional event today. First things first, here are the details of the car itself (if it’s not mentioned it is stock)  2004 Nissan 350z “Enthusiast” package 18x10” RPF1s 305 V710s No stereo/speakers ~2 gallons of gas Injen Super SES dual exhaust (weighed at 15lbs lighter than stock) HFCs K&amp;N CAI Plenum spacer Hotchkis F/R sway bars No spare tire, tools, or rear carpeting/mats(not fastened down from the factory)And what did it weigh in at? 3062lbs That matches up fairly closely to my 2003 Enthusiast I had from 03-06 in b-stock trim. A few other mods on this one, though the old one had a lighter exhaust setup. The 2003 weighed 3075lbs. "

I got there around 7am and put the Kumho tires on the car, big mistake! I was sort of drying out, the sky was almost clear, but the drive down there was rainy, and there was snow! You can’t see it very well in this picture, but yes, there was snow in the â€œhills” around the Bay Area. So I installed the wheels/tires and walked the course a few times. The driver’s meeting got delayed, then the start of the event got delayed. Then the rain started back up Let me tell you this, Kumho V710s don’t work well when it is &lt;40 degrees and raining. My first run I went out and it felt horrible, I turned a 66. *, I wasn’t too thrilled about that. Here’s a video of that run. But I was too lazy to go get my street tires (freshly mounted the previous night mind you). Big mistake, I went out on my second run and decided I would take things slower, expecting to actually go around the course faster. I slowed down and ran a 69. *. That broke this camel’s back, I ran off to get my street wheels, drill, and jack so that I could swap to the Falken Azenis RT-615s. Thankfully Grant (in a Nismo 370z) followed me over and helped me bring 2 of the tires back to my grid spot. I don’t think I would have gotten them changed in time had he not helped! Thanks for the help Grant! The Falkens were MUCH better, not perfect, but way better than the V710s in the rain. I managed to run a 60. *, a big improvement over the first two runs, though I just wish I had put them on before my second run, or even to begin with! Here’s a video of the third run "

They weren’t too thrilled about what I had to offer them, but they did get them mounted (took a while though). A 265 35 18 on an 18x8” wheel is not idea according to them, but they did it nonetheless and I appreciate it. Why the rush to get street tires mounted? It’s been raining here for what seems like weeks and with the divisional being tomorrow morning I wanted to be prepared. I am taking the V710s, but I figured having a new set of street tires would be a good idea if I decided there was too much water for the V710s. I also figured the set that was on there was a little old and bald, not exactly safe in the rain. So tomorrow morning begins another autocross, a two day divisional at Great America in Santa Clara. I went down to register tonight but they had closed up the registration due to all the rain coming down, so I at least found out my work assignment (3rd heat announce) and spent some time driving with my wife and baby. I’ll have video up tomorrow night of the event, we’ll see how things go. I’m hoping it dries a little so that the V710s can have some fun. "

I must say things went fairly well, even with of the normal first event hiccups.  It was my first time running this 350z on RComps, and any 350z on 18” tires on 10” wide wheels. Overall I was impressed, though I long for 315 Hoosier A6s!Today’s event was held at California’s Great America in Santa Clara, CA. I started out slow, but finally kicked it in gear a bit on my 4th and final run. I realized today that I used to drive balls to the wall all the time at an autocross, I guess in my old age I’m not doing that as much, so it took me a while to turn that switch back on. Here’s video of my first run, 42. 7** seconds, 2 cones. Check out some of that inside tire spin, a definite sign that I need to get a new LSD. Here’s my fourth run, I wish I had adjusted the rear camera a bit better, but I can’t change that now. I was shooting video with the ChaseCam and my original GoPro, my GoPro HD had some issues and no longer works. I’m hoping I can get a replacement for it ASAP as next weekend is a two day divisional also being held at Great America, though fortunately this time on a bigger lot, today was awful cramped mid day when all the second session drivers and first session drivers were trying to park and such. So how did I end up for the day? Well, I was running in the Index ( X ) class, and I got stomped! I finished 17 out of 22 in the class, 41st or so overall on the event index. I think I would have been in 3rd place out of 6 had I been running BSP with the regular class. "

Here are the details, the wheels are Enkei RPF1 18”x10” +38 (offset). The tires are Kumho Ecsta V710 305/30/18s. The car currently sits on a stock suspension (2004 350z Enthusiast) With that in mind, I wanted to see what I was going to need to do to make them fit on the car so I can run them at the SCCA Autocross this weekend. The good news is that the wheels/tires fit on the rear perfectly, no changes necessary (at least as of right now on the stock suspension). The wheels and tires unfortunately do not fit on the front, but I kind of expected that, and was surprised they fit on the rear without any trouble. So in order to get the wheels on the front of the car I’m going to need to do a few things.  I need spacers up front, I test fitted a single and double 5mm spacer, 5mm wasn’t enough, but 10mm looks to be right. So in the front I’ll need 10mm at minimum, though I may order a few different spacers for future needs.  Longer studs, I ended up ordering some ARP Studs (part number 100-7717) from www. soloperformance. com via special order. They should be here Friday, in time for me to install them on Saturday. I ordered rear studs as well, but may not put those on immediately.  New lug nuts, with the longer studs I’ll need an open lug nut, I’ll pick those up at autozone or kragen. I think, and we’ll see in a few months, that I can probably get 315s all the way around on these wheels, and with appropriate spacers, that 315 will fit.

On my 2003 350z I had Nismo studs, though they were only on the front, I never got around to putting them on the rear. For this one I could go with the Nismo studs, but it appears a lot of people use ARP studs. So I started looking into what was available  there. The guy I purchased the wheels and tires from uses studs that have a 1. 50 pitch, though stock and the Nismo studs were 1. 25. Doing some research it looks like ARP’s catalog doesn’t have any listings for Nissans, but based on the specs I found on another website they make a couple of part numbers that would likely work. Part Number 100-7717 has a knurl (where it goes into the hub) diameter of . 565 or ~14. 3mm, a length of 3”, knurl length of . 270”, and thread size of M12x1. 5 Part Number 100-7716 has a knurl (where it goes into the hub) diameter of . 565 or ~14. 3mm, a length of 3”, knurl length of . 270”, and thread size of M12x1. 25 I obviously haven’t yet confirmed these fit yet (I’ll update this post when I do), but I’m going to see what I can find for a deal on either of the above part numbers. I’m likely going to need them on my 350z with these new wheels and potentially need  spacers as well. The wheels I picked up are Enkei RPF1 18x10” +38 for all four corners. The tires are used Kumho Victoracer V710s 18” 305. Not what I want to run ultimately, but the best option for me right now as they were already mounted on the wheels! In addition to the wheels and tires I picked up a set of used front and rear Hotchkis sway bars for the 350z. They are the older set, only 3 adjustment points, but they will do for now.    I also picked up some new street tires today as the current ones are getting pretty dangerous in the rain. These are brand new Falken RT615s 265/35R18. Not sure when I will get them mounted, but I’m looking forward to having them on the car. The first event of 2011 for the San Francisco Region SCCA is on the 13th, so a week away. In that time I need to get the following done  Find 20 long studs Find 20 (+) lug nuts Find sway bar end links Install the sway bars Make sure that the new wheels/tires fit on the car.

    "body": "2011/02/02 - Sunday I partook in the NorCalUFO autocross, their second event of the year, my first attending since the baby was born in October. I got to the event and heard that they had a course worker get hit at their last event, unfortunately he was hurt pretty bad and of course doesn’t have insurance, so they were taking donations. I assume that their insurance doesn’t cover the injuries? I believe (could be wrong) that SCCA events always have insurance that would cover someone who got injured, but perhaps I’m wrong. The odd thing is this is the SECOND course worker they’ve had hit in the past 6 or 9 months. Not exactly something that you want to hear when you show up. (Mental note, keep that in mind when signing up for worker positions) WOOOOOOWHOOOO! Fun at an autocross again. It’s been a few events since I’ve really had fun at an autocross. This time around I was still on the crappy street tires, which actually I think are worse than before as the rears are getting pretty bald, it was wet, so that made things more interesting. I started out the morning by driving down to Marina (about an hour and 40 minutes), stopping to get a bite to eat, and then to grab a gallon of gas when I got there. I got to the site around 7:30am and got registered for BSP, and signed up for the â€œcourse monitor” work assignment for the 4th run group. I took 3 video cameras with me (4 if you count my DSLR), my GoProHD, my original GoPro and my ChaseCam. Unfortunately the original GoPro is such as POS that it failed to work for a single runâ€¦ go figure. I love the GoProHD, but I tell you being an early adopter of GoPro (I got the first one in December 2007) was a mistake, their original cameras just flat out suck. If anyone from GoPro is reading this, I will gladly trade you guys my original one for another GoProHD, contact me! My first run I went out with tire pressures around 48/46psi, it was like a drifter’s dream, wet surface, bald tires with high pressure, the rear end was moving around like a girl putting herself through college in east St. Louis. Here’s a video of the run, both from the top of the car, and inset with the passenger side view of the right front tire, watch all over the steering correction while the car dances. With all that moving around I was sure when I cross the finish lights I had taken out at least 4 cones, but the final results show only 1, but a nice and slow time of 53 seconds. The second run was a little better than the first, improving on raw time, and clean. The third run however is another story, I was going okay until a couple of turns before the finish when the rear of the car decided to do the old Sauget shuffle and batted a few cones off course (video coming soon) My third run was the fastest up to that point, but I had 4 cones today based on the results. My 4th and final run was when the fun finally kicked in. The course was starting to dry out more and I took a serious drop in tire pressure, going down to 38/36. Talk about a big improvement, the tires were starting to squeal (I hate street tires) due to the drying surface. I got down to around a 48. 9 on that run. Much improvement, not enough to put me into the lead in BSP but I was happy with a very under prepared car on super cheap street tires. Here’s the video from Run 4. You can also check out some external videos of the 350z running, though you’ll have to dig through Will’s 20 minute video he posted to find them! (fast forward to around 4:46) https://vimeo. com/19393008 I’m already signed up for the SFRSCCA Divisional which is running the weekend of 2/19. I’m also planning on hitting the SCCA event the weekend before, hopefully both events I’ll have the car shod in some r-compound tires and some nice fatty wheels. "

    "body": "2011/01/31 - So this isn’t the blog post I had intended to write today, but I think it’s a useful one nonetheless. For those of you who autocross, or partake in any other motorsports. How do you travel with your video equipment? Discussion on where you mount your cameras and such, and what types of cameras will be left for another set of blog posts, but for now, how do you get your equipment to a race? If you’re a small time autocrosser like me, you likely aren’t towing your car around on an enclosed trailer with lots of storage space. At this point I have 3-6 potential video cameras I could take/use at any one race. Two GoPro’s (one HD and one of the SUPER CRAPPY original versions), a Chase Cam/PDR, plus a Canon HV10, 5d Mark II and a point and shoot that will do video. Now granted, I will almost likely never put the 5d Mark II on the car, I do take it to events so that I can take photos. So what’s the best way to get things to an event? Right now I’m packing things into a lowepro 300aw, and that is probably the best solution for the time being, but with all that equipment I’m going to have to trim back what I put in the bag (less lenses for the 5D). What do you use? A Pelican case? A bag? Something else? "

    "title": "The 350z goes on a Diet",
    "body": "2011/01/31 - On Saturday the 350z went on a diet, losing (rough guess here) about 3% of it’s total weight. When I purchased the car in January of 2010 I knew a few things. The stereo in the car was aftermarket, and so were the two 10” subs in the back of the car. Beyond that I also assumed there was an amplifier somewhere powering the subs, but I wasn’t really sure what else there was. I decided to remove the subwoofers so that I could drop some weight in the car. I liked the sound, but this car has a purpose, autocross, and the subs were not designed for that purpose. Yesterday I found out what else was in there. There were TWO amps behind the driver’s seat in the compartment where the stock subwoofer would go on a Bose equipped 350z. They were in there mounted to a wooden structure, but ultimately just floating around in the compartment. That means they probably got a good tossing or two at the two autocrosses I went to previously. Once I started getting the interior paneling out of the car so that I could remove the sub enclosure I located the amplifiers, and then I started to discover that all of the speakers in the car were being powered by the amps, which told me that they were not likely wired up to the stock stereo harness anymore. I could have left the amps in and the speakers, and only removed the sub enclosure, but I decided if I was going to try to make this car competitive in BSP (hopefully ESP for 2012) I was going to have to go all in. So I pulled it all. I removed the subs, amps, speakers, and even the stereo from the dash. Fortunately for me BSP allows removal of the stereo/speakers as long as you don’t remove the OEM wiring, so I was covered there. All in all I pulled out about 100lbs of equipment from the car. 45 for the sub+enclosure, 40 for the amps/bracket, and probably 5-6lbs of wiring (remember it wasn’t using the stock wiring, the power and grounds were 2 gauge, HUGE wires. The 4 speakers and the stereo itself easily weighing in around 10lbs, for a total of around 100lbs. Not a bad diet for a day’s work. I’ll talk more about what I am doing for tunes in tomorrow’s blog post where I review the first autocross of 2011. For now here’s the video from the stereo removal.  &lt;div style= padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px  id= scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:739a7655-a90d-4d42-b929-2a56448fe3b4  class= wlWriterEditableSmartContent &gt;&lt;div id= 64bd917b-9b78-426d-b119-19a4b59e16c1  style= margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline; &gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=”/assets/images/PublishThumbnails/Windows-Live-Writer/The-350z-goes-on-a-Diet_12F66/videoc902b241d5d3. jpg” style=”border-style: none” galleryimg=”no” onload=”var downlevelDiv = document. getElementById(‘64bd917b-9b78-426d-b119-19a4b59e16c1’); downlevelDiv. innerHTML = “&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width= 448  height= 252 &gt;&lt;param name= movie  value= https://www. youtube. com/v/GGqoF9s0djQ?hl=en&amp;hd=1 &gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src= https://www. youtube. com/v/GGqoF9s0djQ?hl=en&amp;hd=1  type= application/x-shockwave-flash  width= 448  height= 252 &gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;”;” alt=””&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style= width:448px;clear:both;font-size:. 8em &gt;350z Stereo Removal (autocross weight savings)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; "

    "title": "350z Trailer Hitch, Take 2",
    "body": "2011/01/26 - So for my 2003 350z I had a custom trailer hitch built by a friend in St. Louis. It was hefty, mounting with ubolts through the bottom of the bumper and then a bar running forward to the differential. It weighed quite a bit, but was somewhat easy to remove at autocross events if I was concerned about the weight. I just spent the last hour and a half trying to dig up an old photo of the hitch, but have so far been unable to do so! I’m hoping to get some photos from the company who made the hitch (no longer produced or sold, but we’ll see if they still have them). I did finally locate a photo of when the hitch was being built! Though it really isn’t useful for much, here it is. This is the mount at the rear diff.  UPDATE: I got some photos from the company who produced the hitch (just a reminder, the company is no longer in business and the hitch is no longer available    Then of course there is the car actually towing at trailer. This photo was taken in the parking lot at the Jack Daniel’s Distillery in Lynchburg Tennessee in April 2005, just a few days after the hitch was constructed. I always loved this photo So why the hitch post now? Well, it’s that time. Time to get a hitch for the 350z, why? Because autocross season is coming up and I need a way to get wheels and tires to the events! So I ordered a Curt hitch for the 350z today. It’s about as different as can be from the hitch that was on my old car. It mounts only to the bumper, and requires trimming the rear bumper cover a bit. I’m not too big a fan of that, but it appears to be the only real option for hitches at this point. I am going to see if I need to reinforce anything when I get the hitch on and a trailer. Previously, as you can see in the photo I had a rather large trailer, a 6x8. I purchased the 6x8 so that I could haul a couple of sets of tires (I think the most I ever carried was 3, plus a motorcycle. I am pretty sure I don’t have any pictures of the motorcycle on the trailer behind the Camaro (which was what I had at the time). I don’t know exactly what I will do for a trailer this time around, I will likely get something a little bigger than standard harbor freight tire trailer (I would like to be able to carry two sets of tires), though I won’t buy brand new like I did last time. I will probably peruse craigslist when the time comes, I just found a 4x6 enclosed utility trailer on there for $200 this evening that would be something that could work (when the time comes). I’ll do a video/blog post of the hitch install this weekend if I can get to it. I’m hoping to hit the NorCalUFO autocross in Marina on Sunday. "

    "body": "2011/01/23 - If you followed the blog post earlier this week you already know that Injen came through and got me the replacement midpipes for my Super SES Exhaust which I removed late last year. Today I took the OEM exhaust off the 350z and put the Injen exhaust back on. The job itself is easy, probably could do it all in about 25 minutes if I really pushed it, but I didn’t. I took my time, cleaned up in the garage a bit, cleaned up the exhaust a bit as well. I also managed to weigh both the Injen exhaust and the OEM exhaust to see what the difference was. I was hoping it would be more!                Exhaust       Weight                 OEM 350z Exhaust       Y-pipe (15lbs) Midpipe (10lbs) Muffler (35lbs)            Total 60lbs                 Injen Super SES Exhaust       Midpipes (10lbs each) Muffler (15lbs each)            Total 50lbs         (these weights were taken on a standard bathroom scale, not sure of their accuracy) So installing the Super SES Exhaust should save me ~10lbs over the stock setup, providing more flow and hopefully more horse power. I had the car dyno’d back in April of 2010 with the original Super SES setup on it, I will have to find the dyno sheets but if I recall correctly it was around 259 to the rear wheels. Not bad considering I believe my first Z in stock form on a totally different dyno setup, did around 219 to the rear. I setup my GoPro HD today to take a photo every 2 seconds while I was working, I think it turned out well, though a number of the shots are a little dark in the garage, I think I can fix that next time. I also took a number of photos of the exhaust before putting it on.    The rear of the exhaust after cleaning up the muffler/tips    The new mid pipes from Injen The old and new mid pipes, you can see on the new one that there is extra reinforcement now to prevent the cracking that caused the leak on the original setup.

Well I am happy to say that I no longer have that problem! Injen contacted me and apologized for the lack of responses previously. I was still somewhat cautious, but they did say that they could help me by sending me the parts I needed to fix the leaking system (at a cost, but I didn’t expect them for free). The parts showed up today! So, to Injen, thank you for your help! I’ll be installing the exhaust this weekend, taking the OEM setup back out. I’ll have to try to weigh everything before I put it in, and then the OEM one when it comes out to compare. On an unrelated note to the exhaust. In the 2011 February Fastrack the SCCA is proposing moving the 350z from BSP to ESP. I’m going to have to write a letter, or 3, in support of that move! "

I was curious how much they would charge to mount and balance for 18” tires. For those of you who don’t autocross, it is very common for autocrossers to need a local tire changing service, while not purchasing the tires from that location as well. I’ve had placed charge anywhere from $60 to $80. When I asked Les Schwab what they would charge he told me $149, I literally laughed, said thank you, and walked out. I’ll be tasked now with finding a local shop who will hopefully do it for cheaper. I was spoiled in St. Louis, I had access to the tire machine at [Solo Performance Specialties](https://www. soloperformance. com/, I had a % share in the machine, actually I still do. It might be cheaper just to ship wheels and tires to Dave and have him mount them. Getting them shipped back though might make that cost prohibitive Anyone got any leads to a good tire mounting shop on the peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area? "

I think I’ve corrected all the links and am posting it here. I will be doing the same with other old posts. Disclaimer: This article is just an example of a task we completed on the Project 350Z. We do not recommend you try this yourself unless you are a trained professional. We cannot be held liable for any damage to your vehicle or harm you cause to yourself while working on your vehicle. Please use safety equipment, our work was done on a vehicle lift, if you use a jack, use jack stands for safety. Project 350Z Koni Sport InstallI finally broke down and bought some Koni Sports for the Project Z. I say finally, but they really have only been stateside for 2 months now, so I didn’t wait all that long to order them. At the end of this write-up, you’ll find a summary of my autocross career, to get a better understanding of the author of this piece. The part numbers are as follows:  8241-1216L Sport Left Front 8241-1216R Sport Right Front 8241-1217 Sport Rear (single)Installation proceduresI have the Nissan Service Manual for the 350Z, and would highly recommend purchasing one as they are invaluable when it comes to working on your vehicle. I won’t be using any photos from the manual, as reproducing it on the web would most likely be a little frowned upon by Nissan. I will, however, try to include pictures with notations on installation procedures. I would also recommend checking out the article on SportZ Magazine’s latest issue on the Koni install procedure, I received a copy of the article and found it to be very helpful. To begin the car was placed on our lift and raised off of the ground about 3 feet. We removed all four wheels from the vehicle before we did any other work to make everything easier and to get them out of the way.  The shocks come in two separate boxes, one box for the fronts, and one for the rears.  Rear Shock InstallI started with the rear of the car, and it was by far the easiest method to take. The rears each require the removal of 1 bolt, and 2 nuts to remove from the car.  Once you have one removed from the car you’ll see the top mount. I removed this top nut from the shock using an impact gun. It may take a little working with to get it removed without spinning the shaft too much, but if you drive it back on and off a few times it will usually free up. Being that this was a stock shock which would only go back on the car if I sell it, I wasn’t too concerned with spinning the shaft. I do not recommend using a gun to drive the nut back onto the Koni shock, more on that later. Now to reassemble the rear shocks. I didn’t take a picture of the parts included with the rears but you can sort of see this bag in the picture below (yellow arrow), there is a nut in there for the bottom shock mount, a nut for the shaft, and a what is really just a large metal washer that goes into the upper shock mount. This is how the stock upper mount comes off of the stock shock (upside down). You’ll want to set aside the metal shield that has a red arrow marked discard on it. . The washer is used to keep the rubber grommet (yellow arrow marked grommet) from pushing down on the rear shock adjustment mechanism. Please notice the installation order in the picture, you would really hate to get everything installed incorrectly wouldn’t you? (see our front install for an example ?) You’ll notice a little orange ring; to me it appears to be a gasket for the upper mount to the body of the car. I just left this in place throughout the install. Please see the included Koni paperwork, what little there actually is, for the proper torque settings for the nut on the top of the shock. You can tighten down this nut with a wrench, and use a pair of pliers or channel locks to hold the shaft in place, notice the flat sides of the top of the shaft for this. When putting the shock back onto the car here is a tip I pulled out of the article in SportZ Magazine. You can compress the shock before you put it back on the car, it will slow rebound it self back into position, but it should give you PLENTY of time to get the shock in place on the car. I would recommend compressing the shock, get it lined up with the lower mount and the upper mount, then put the bolt (from the stock shock) into the bottom mount of the shock with the Koni included nut on the other side of the mount. This will keep the base of the shock in place while you try to get the upper mount installed. The upper mount may be a little tricky to line up, if the shock doesn’t rebound completely to the top of the fender wheel (to the mounting bolts) you may try raising the rear suspension of the side you are working on with a jack, basically compressing it as though the car where sitting with weight on that corner. This will allow getting the shock into the upper mount properly without too much hassle. Tighten down the bolts on the top mount, see image 16 above. One thing to remember when doing this install, you want the adjustment mechanism of the shock to be easily accessible, so you want it facing out, you should be able to turn it a little when you have the shock back on the car, but it’s best to try to have it facing out to begin with. Don’t forget to torque down the lower mount as well. The article from SportZ Magazine recommends doing this while the car is setting on the ground, for the front and the rear shocks, as tightening the lower mounts at this time help to prevent premature wear on the components. That isn’t exactly the easiest thing to do, but I would highly recommend it. If you don’t get the lower bolt/nut tightened well you will get a clunking noise from this lower mount. (ask me how I know). Repeat this process on the other rear shock for the car. This is what it looks like when finished. Front Shock InstallThe front shock install requires a bit more work than the rear install did. You will also need a spring compressor of some sort to disassemble the front shock units. I borrowed this tool from a local autozone. Basically the way it works is you pay for the tool and you return it when you are done if you want your money back. This isn’t like the Wal-mart rental policy; this is actually a legit program. The FSM tells you to remove the wheel, and then the under cover. I never did figure out what the â€œunder cover” was that it referenced, but I obviously didn’t have to remove it to get the shock out if I couldn’t find it. (This step differs on cars with TCS and VDC, this step was performed on a car with only TCS) Next you will remove the Wheel sensors from the back of the hub. The wheel sensor has a cable that is marked with the yellow arrows in this image . This image shows what the sensor looks like mounted on the back of the hub. . When removing the wheel sensor be careful, the FSM specifically says not to pull on the wheel sensor.  Pull out the two grommets where the wire is attached to the shock body, and then use a wrench or socket to remove the bolt holding the sensor itself to the hub. Place the sensor up and out of the way, try not to twist the cable too much, when you go to install the sensor again make sure that the white line does not twist upon install. I set the sensor on what I would assume is the â€œunder cover” towards the front of the car to keep it and the cable out of the way while I removed the shock.  . Next remove the nut that holds the brake hose to the shock absorber . Pull the mount off of the shock and push the brake line aside.   You’ll also need to remove the strut tower bar. To do this you’ll want to fix the center bolt in place and loosen the nut on the left and right side of that center bolt. Once those are lose you’ll want to turn the center top towards the rear of the car 660 degrees, that should place the silver mark of the center bolt above. Remove the 3 bolts and one nut from each of the strut bar mounts and remove the bar from the vehicle. One thing the FSM doesn’t tell you to do, but the SportZ article recommends is to remove this cotter pin and nut, this will give you some slack when removing the shock and make removal a lot easier. Note: Yours should not be painted, I took mine to a horrible place and they did a horrible job repainting the front end. I also remove the nut from the sway bar link to the transverse bar (no picture).   Remove the bolt and nut on the lower shock mount, holding the shock to the transverse link. (I don’t seem to have a picture of this either). You may want to leave the bolt in the lower mount to help keep it in place while you perform the next step. Now you’ll remove the nuts from the upper mount, you should see them exposed by the removal of the strut bar. Remove the bolt from the lower mount and you should now be able to pull the assembly off of the car. If you need to you can put a little pressure on the break disc to push the lower suspension assembly down to give you better access to remove the assembly. Front Shock disassembly(ALWAYS USE CAUTION WHEN WORKING WITH SPRINGS)Using the spring compressor from the picture above compress the spring so that it has a little play between the lower spring perch and the upper mount. This will allow you to remove the nut from the top of the shock. I used an impact gun for removal, if it doesn’t come off easily on the first try, drive the nut back down and try removal again, working it in this manner helped me remove the nuts without much trouble. Without an impact gun, you’ll need to try to hold the top of the shock in place with locks and turn the nut with a wrench. From past experience, try to use an impact gun for this, or you should spend hours trying to get things apart. Once you have the nut free remove the upper mount and boot (attached) you can then remove the compressed spring. Koni supplies you with these parts, along with a spring perch that goes on the shock body. The white washer goes on top of the shock body (yellow arrow) and the spring perch sets where the red arrow is pointing. This is NOT how the spring perch goes, this picture shows the perch in an upside down position. To see if you have the perch lined up properly put the perch on the new shock and hold the new and old shock side by side, you’ll see if the perches line up. I learned that little trick after I reassembled the right front shock, so I had to redo that side. When holding them up side by side you should be able to line the perch up on the new shock body closely to the way the perch is fixed on the stock body. This allows for the proper placement of the spring, which eases the assembly of the assembly back onto the vehicle. Place the spring back onto the perch, still compressed in the spring compressors, and then put the boot and upper mount back onto the shock. You will at this time need to put the washer and nut included in the picture of parts above back onto the shock. This should be done by hand, not with an impact gun as you don’t want to PreLoad the shock’s rebound settings by twisting the shaft. You should be able to hand twist the nut on, and use a pair of wrenches to get the nut on securely. If you do not get this nut on tight it WILL make noise. It took me a few days of lifting the car up and down trying to figure out where I was getting a knocking from. It ended up being because when I had to redo the right front shock I didn’t get the nut on the shaft of the shock tightened down properly. The proper torque settings are included in the Koni documentation, which I do not have handy at the moment. Once you have the nut tightened down on the shock you’ll need to remove the spring compressors. Now it’s time to install this assembly back onto the car. I did the install in this manner. Get the top of the shock assembly into the general area of the upper mounting point so that the shaft of the shock is inside the open hole at the top of the mount. Try to get the lower mount into place, feed the included bolt from Koni into the lower mount to hold the assembly in place but don’t tighten it down yet. From the top of the car, you can pull up on the spring to raise the suspension assembly into place to align the three bolts in the upper strut mount to line up properly with the three holes in the body of the car. Get at least one of the nuts started so that you can quit pulling up on the spring! Everything else should be fairly straightforward to reinstall. Be sure to properly torque everything down to the settings in the FSM. When installing the wheel sensors be sure to not twist the cables. I can speak from experience, go over everything, make sure you tighten everything down, the little knocks get rather annoying, and it’s easier to get everything the first time then to have to go back and look for something you missed. I’ll have to do a write-up on the performance of these shocks next week. From a week and a half of driving, and one autocross event though I will include a few observations. First Event on KonisI ran a two day divisional less than 48 hours after installing the Koni’s on the Project 350Z. The first day I started with the rear shocks at 3 turns from full soft, and the front at one full turn from full soft. To give you an idea of what settings the shocks have I believe the rears have 12 turns to get to their stiffest rebound setting, and the fronts appear to have 2. 5 full turns from soft to firm. Each turn on the rear is probably Â¼ of a turn if they were adjusted from the top as the fronts are. After my 2nd run I decided to try taking out Â½ turn from the fronts. This was what I would call a mistake! The car got extremely loose on my 3rd run, which helped to kick the ABS ice-mode on, a problem I had last year at the Topeka ProSolo, and Carter had in his 350Z at Nationals last year. We figure this is caused by the car sensing one wheel is different from the others, probably off the ground when the others are on the ground, so the brakes freak out and don’t want to stop the car. It doesn’t pulse like ABS is kicking in, but the car stops breaking like it should and decelerates at a slower rate. My 99 Camaro had the same problem on the Topeka concrete under extremely hard braking. For my 4th run I put Â¼ turn back into the shocks, this made a pretty good combination, as the car felt more settled than run 3, but still loose enough to work with. On Monday (2nd day) I left the settings the same on the car, and ran a bit closer to the leader in BS for the weekend. I ended up in 3rd for the event, I had been in 4th by . 005 or so behind Lee from Oklahoma in a Track model 2004 I believe. I’m headed to OKC this weekend for the 2nd divisional event, and will report back on my settings when I return! I hope this is helpful to someone else out there in doing their install. If you have any questions, or notice any blatant errors in this please feel free to let me know via the comment section of this blog! About the Myself (the author)I’ve been autocrossing since March of 2000. I started out in a 1994 VW Golf III, and competed in that car for about 15 months. I competed in my first National Tour event in Peru Indiana in July, and then the SCCA Solo II Nationals in September. I finished last in both events in the newly formed STS (street touring) class. In July of 2001 I decided I wanted to buy a car that I knew could be competitive with just the minor modifications that were allowed in the stock classing structure of SCCA Solo II. I decided on F-Stock, and started looking for a 4th Generation F-Body (Camaro) that would suite my needs. I was looking around St. Louis for a few weeks for a LS-1 powered (98+) 6 speed, that wasn’t in Red. I found a 1999 Z-28 in Macon Missouri and picked it up. I immediately purchased a set of Koni Shocks for the car, an extra set of wheels, and some R-compound tires. At the Solo Nationals that year (2001) I still got kicked in the rear, but not near as bad this time! I can’t seem to find the results from that year, but I think I finished something like 47th out of 54. In 2002 I finished 14th in F-Stock out of 35+ entrants. I also finished 3rd in F-Stock at the Topeka ProSolo that April. In 2003 I decided to change vehicles and purchased my 2003 Nissan 350Z Enthusiast model. I acquired a second set of the stock Enthusiast 17” wheels for a set of R-compound tires. I competed last year at the Peru National Tour, the Topeka ProSolo and the SCCA Solo II Nationals. At Nationals I finished 43rd out of 60 drivers. I was the second fastest 350Z driver, but far behind Carter Thompson who finished 6th. I was also running on Kumhos, even though the 2003 Results say I was on Hoosiers. Along comes 2004, I kind of lost interest in autocross up through the end of May. I guess I go through a little lull every year, this year it happened in April and May. To get out of the lull I ordered the Koni Sports (yellows) for the car. "

This system was a true dual exhaust setup from the cats back. You might also remember I’ve complained a few times about it leaking. Well, I finally gave in. Injen wasn’t helpful in getting me a replacement part to repair the leaking section (at the welds) so I went and purchased an OEM exhaust from a local guy off of My350z. com. I’ve had the exhaust sitting in my garage for a month or more, and finally got around to making room to get the car in and up on jackstands so that I could take the POS Injen system off the car. In the spirit of all the videos I used to do for Project240z. com (and for all the future videos I plan to do here) I’ve done another time lapse. Here’s the YouTube video, you can hear the Injen exhaust as I back in, the car without any exhaust system connected to the cats, and then the OEM exhaust. (the first part of the video is me cleaning up the garage, much needed so I could make room for the car) I must say, I kind of liked the sound of the car when I fired it up without any exhaust (dumping at the cats), though I’m sure my neighbors didn’t care for it, and I’m 100% positive the police wouldn’t like me driving around like that either. The stock exhaust is far too quiet, but it will have to do for now. Here in the next few weeks I’ll be putting together a blog post on parts and modifications I need to make to the car for the 2011 autocross season. I’m still not sure what class I will run in yet, either STR, BSP, or maybe even SSM. I need to see if anyone makes a trailer hitch for a 350z so that I can haul wheels and tires around. I know I had one before, but the guy who made it isn’t making them anymore. I’ll also need to locate another trailer. To be honest, if I was in Missouri I would just call up the buddy who purchased my 03 350z and ask for the hitch and trailer, he’s not using them! I’ve yet to decide what I’ll do with the Injen system. I may try to sell it, I may take it somewhere for scrap. Injen, if you’re reading this, I’m still open to putting the SuperSES system back on the car, but I need your help replacing the midpipes to do that! I’m even willing to pay, but I need you guys to respond to basic customer service emails. "

Great work, I hope to hear more about the car in the future. I’m still debating what is going on with the 350z, one day I want to trade it and get an EVO or STI, other days I want to keep it and put a turbo on it.

    "body": "2010/09/30 - This is often a question that people will ask when they first start autocrossing, or in my case, when they resume autocrossing after two years of not competing. Additional questions about autocross include: How do I get better? Do I really suck this bad? Why am I so slow? How do I get faster? The way you get better at Autocross is by doing it more. I don’t mean by going slower when you are on course so you get more time at each event. The key to getting better is to do it more! Go to more events, run as many as you can afford to enter and are willing to drive to. If you aren’t fortunate enough to live in an area that has a large number of events, I recommend trying to find events outside of your area. They will likely require more time and money commitments, getting to and from the events, but it really is all about the Seat Time! I am in that boat, I haven’t autocrossed competitively in over 2 years, since I sold the Corvette (www. corvettez06. org), due to a couple of moves across the country, buying (and selling) our first house, and prepping to have our first child (www. jacquelinehammond. com). You can also attend autocross schools, I’ve been to those put on by Evolution Performance Driving School multiple times, and highly recommend it as an option, though I think you should have a year or so of autocross under your belt before you attend one. Also check your local area for autocross schools put on by clubs, they are a great way to get started, and actually that was how I got into autocross back in 2000, by attending a local autox school in St. Louis. So how do I plan to get better at autocross? By going to as many events as my budget, life, and wife will let me go to! I’m fortunate that I live in the Bay Area (SF, CA) as there are events here almost every weekend, and in a lot of weekends multiple events going on. "

I left San Carlos early in the morning and headed off to pick up Will Strohl. We headed down to Marina California for the Northern California United Five-Ten Owners Club We headed south towards Marina, and decided we wanted to try to grab some food, unfortunately we didn’t have much luck finding anything, and ended up going a different way than Google Maps originally said. Though, to be honest, I think we went a better way, we headed down 101 to 156, and bypassed the hills/mountains over towards Santa Cruz. We were there before the gates opened, and when they did we were two of the first people there. We walked the course as typical at an autocross to get a feel for where you were supposed to drive during the event. I ended up working the first heat, and running the third, so while I was busy working Strohl sat around watching, shot a little video, and texted with his significant other to keep himself entertained. When it came time to run in the third heat Will helped me get the car ready, and I was ready to line up. I went out on my first run by myself, with the plan to see the course completely and try not to make a fool of myself when the second run came up and Will came along for a ride. Here’s the video from my first run, unfortunately I seem to have picked up an old habit from my past autocross days. My first run was my fastest for the day. And now for the fun part of it, check this video out of Will Strohl on his first ride along, my second run. Overall the event was just so so for me. It was good to be back and autocrossing, though i was disappointed with my performance. I ran in BSP for the event, or at least I think I did, the event organization was a little different than I am used to having run primarily SCCA events for most of my autocross career. I don’t know what the end results are for the event, everything was done on paper, so I imagine it will be a few days before the results are actually posted. What I did learn, or remember, is that running the 350z on street tires is not fun! Now I need to figure out what I’m really going to do with this car. We’ve got a kid coming, VERY SOON, so I need to find something that I can drive that is kid friendly, though I hope to not have to get rid of the 350z. I hope to get to autocross again in the next couple months, we will see. I’m thinking that this car might be fun to play with in SSM, but that might entail a turbo and lots of other toys! I took a number of photos at the event, here are some of me, and then the full Flickr Set.  "

    "body": "2010/08/10 - So I spent the afternoon yesterday trying to repair a leak in the Injen Super SES Exhaust system that was on the 350z when I purchased the car back in January. Sometime in March the exhaust started leaking and it has slowly gotten worse. Normally I would of just scrapped it and put something else on, but with all the life changes (new job, moved to California, trying to sell the house in Colorado, prepping for our first child) we’ve been going through the budget hasn’t allowed for that at this point. When I was down at Z Car Garage with the car on the lift a few months ago we figured out where the leak was, at the seam of the resonator/muffler in the middle pipe of the exhaust system on the driver’s side. Yesterday I finally took the time to get the car into the garage and up on jack stands. I pulled the middle exhaust pipe out off the driver’s side and it was very apparent where the leak was occurring, on the exit side of the resonator, there was pretty much a ring all the way around the pipe and the muffler where it was separated, the entrance side though looked fine. So I went to Autozone yesterday to get some exhaust sealer, hoping that I would be able to patch up the leak, and at least provide a temporary fix, to get me through the next few months so I could do something different this winter when I start to prep the car for the 2011 SCCA Autocross season. With the pipe out of the car I took a Dremel tool to the edges around the crack to try to prep the surface a bit. After that I cleaned up the surface a bit and then applied the sealant to the surface. The directions said to leave the sealant for 4 hours, then heat the surface for 10 to 15 minutes. I went ahead and took this approach, using a heat gun to slowly warm the sealant up. This was the end result.  After work tonight I went to O’Reilly and Kragen Auto Parts to get two new gaskets for the pipe and put everything back in the car. I started the car up and all was well, no leak! I took the car down off the jack stands, we’ll see what the video looks like, but damn lucky I wasn’t under the car when two of the jack stands came down! I seem to have good luck with themâ€¦. I took the car for a drive and thought all was well, the exhaust sounded great and I didn’t hear any leaks. When I got home and pulled in the driveway however the leaks were back. I sure wish I hadn’t sold the welder before we left Colorado! I would try my hand at fixing this, though I doubt I’d do well with the stainless steel. So here we are, back at square one. I’ve emailed Injen, I’m hoping they will come through with an option to possibly just purchase the two middle pipes at a reasonable cost. We’ll see how it goes. My next option is probably to look for a stock (OEM) exhaust on My350z. com from someone local, that may be my best option. And of course, in honor of Project240z. com, the video is above, I put it together from the work yesterday (After working on cleaning up the garage to make room for the car first). I also created a video of tonight’s work while I installed the pipe back in. "

I hope to get the office setup tomorrow and at least room for the car in the garage tomorrow if I can get a hold of the exhaust. I’ve also been cheating on the 350z a little bit. I put money down on a commuter replacement, by registering during the preregistration period for the Nissan Leaf, I even setup a site for it, no not projectleaf, but leafowner. com. I don’t intend to get rid of the 350z, but if I do get a Leaf the Z will see far less street usage! More updates coming soon! I might even video the work tomorrow. "

    "body": "2010/04/06 - So this weekend while my beautiful wife was in town (haven’t seen her for three weeks!) I rented a car for the weekend? Why? Well, to be honest, the 350z wasn’t legal to be driving around on the roads of California! The temporary tags expired on the 1st, and I had planned to hit the DMV up on the 2nd, only to figure out that California had state employees on furlough so the DMV is closed the first three Fridays in April. Welcome to California! So I rented a car for the weekend, a Mid-sized from National (via Hotwire) and we picked out a black New Beetle. It wasn’t a half bad ride for the weekend, the windshield felt like it was 10 miles away, and I would hate to try to sit in the back seat, but for the two of us it worked out fine. Over the weekend I tried to figure out what I was going to do with the 350z, I need to get some OEM Cats (catalytic converters) to put back on the car as it came with non-oem ones when I purchased it from the dealer in Colorado. (quick tip: if you buy a car in Colorado, you have three days to have a smog test, if it fails you can take it back to the dealer, I learned this far too late) I found a few options for getting some OEM Cats and even found a shop locally that will put them on for me saving me the hassle of doing it myself. Normally this wouldn’t be a big deal, but as we haven’t moved all of our stuff from Colorado yet I don’t exactly have a jack and stands to get under the car to do the swap myself. I’m hoping that cats are all I need to get the car to pass emissions, having purchased the car previously modded (Stevinson Lexus of Frederick in Colorado so far has been unresponsive in my inquiries about why they would sell a car that wouldn’t pass smog), I don’t know exactly what has been done to the car beyond what I can see. We will see if Cats make it legal for California or not. If not I’m likely going to be up a creek! Monday morning I headed off to the DMV, arriving there at 7:10am, with 5 other cars already in the parking lot. Around 7:25am we started lining up out front to wait for the doors to open at 8am. I was third in line. About 15 minutes or so before 8am an employee from the DMV came out and handed out Window numbers for the first people in line, telling you which window to go directly to when the doors opened up. You know there’s way too much F’n demand and not enough supply when a DMV office has to do this. I wasn’t in there too long, it was actually very painless for me. When I left though the line was backed up out there door, had to be at least 75 people waiting to get in, not to mention all the people already in side and waiting. I was able to get a two month temp tag from the state for the 350z, so now I’m somewhat legal to drive around as I work to get the car to pass smog. Hopefully I can get that done here in the next couple of weeks. Sunday I’m going to the Z Car Garage for a ZONC (Z cars of Northern California) dyno day. I’m curious to see what numbers the car puts down in it’s current form and then want to get it dyno’d again after swapping the Cats to see if there’s a big difference. I’ll take plenty of pictures down there, I’m looking forward to meeting some other Z guys this weekend. "

Today, for the first time since likely 1995 I spent time washing and waxing a car in California. And the weather was beautiful! I spent the yesterday evening and today up at a friend’s house in Fairfield, the town I went to high school in. We had dinner with friends from HS last night, and then this morning I spent the day cleaning up my the 350z for the first time since picking it up, and boy did it need it, especially after the 1200 mile road trip (on the back of an open trailer last week from Colorado to California). I washed the car, clay barred the various marks and such in the paint, washed it again, and then waxed the car. It looks mucho better now, if I do say so for myself. Here are some pictures of the beauty after her bath.  The rest of the afternoon I hung out and had a BBQ with friends, and new friends. I had a great time, but had to head back down here to San Mateo so I can work tomorrow. I made the drive in 1hr and 10 minutes. If only traffic were that nice all the time I might consider buying a house in my old stomping grounds and commuting to work. But I can only imagine that most days that would be a 2+ hr drive during commute times. Some day, perhaps later this week, I’ll get around to blogging about the Project350z’s first autocross which happened a few weeks ago. "

    "title": "Saying Goodbye",
    "body": "2010/02/01 - (Idea blatantly stolen from James Nelson’s Saying Goodbye post) We’ve been together for almost 4 years, you and I. It was love at first sight, but it took an internet chat conversation with 4 guys to get you where I wanted you. Once your previous owner let a price slip I jumped on the opportunity to buy you, and a week later you, and a billion parts, were loaded up into a trailer for the trip home. I got you home and you fit right in next to your younger sister, it wasn’t long before she left our family to join Dozzle in Kansas City (she’s been recently reincarnated though). The next 6 months you didn’t get much attention, but you did gain an unsightly brother, a 1978 2+2 that you would learn to love later in life, as he provided a replacement heart for you, along with eye sockets and chest plate to cover the heart. In June, about a month after you did start off strong in June by losing your inner self. That was the start of something beautiful, you became an internet star, getting thousands upon thousands of views of your videos. You even show up very high in the search results for 240z. It was the spring of 2007 before any real progress was made on you, with the very generous help of many friends you got a new heart. With that new heart you even got to stretch your legs a bit in July and August of that year. Before your legs were fully stretched though I decided it would be a good idea to give those legs a go on an autocross course, no video of that day is available, but there are photos of your glorious and fateful run. Though you didn’t even get to complete the full run, I had to get out and assist you, and recruit other help as well, to get back to your grid position. You punished me for taking you out for an autocross too early in your recovery, and showed me your displeasure by destroying the number 2 piston, and providing a nice beautiful mix of oil and coolant when I get you home and drained you. After this incident you sat for a quite a while, really until late 2008, you lived partially in a warehouse, sometimes in the garage in Missouri. Though with a little effort you got a new heart put in, you even got to cruise around the neighborhood one last time before being loaded onto the trailer and taken to our new home in Colorado.  Life in Colorado wasn’t as grand as you had hoped though. You did get some attention here and there, but new priorities in life got in the way of the real attention you needed. It was then decided that you would be better served by finding a new owner. Today that new owner came and took you away. I hope you enjoy your new life, you were my first real project car, and while I never completed you, I am grateful for the time we spent together. I will miss you 240z, perhaps one day in the future I may run into one of your twins. "

My 2003 350Z weighed in at 3075lbs in race trim, which included the 17” Enkei RPF1s, as little fuel as possible, and all the loose items in the rear of the car removed (carpet, spare tire, tools). I also had the stock exhaust removed, and a NISMO Y-Pipe. The car was a 2003 Enthusiast with only front airbags, aluminum door sills, and splash guards. My new car is a 2004 Enthusiast, with aluminum door sills, no splash guards, front airbags only, and a few other custom mods I will document later. I have a feeling it weighs quite a bit more than my 03 did, but I’m hoping to get it down under 3k pounds if possible. Things I will be looking at:  Replacing seats Removing the custom sub woofers/amps (removal post) Lighter wheels Lighter battery Lightweight flywheel Suspension mods"

    "body": "2010/01/27 - So I’m slowly starting to figure out what I need to do to get the car ready for the 2010 Autocross season. I’ve been looking around, reading the 2010 SCCA Solo rules, covering the details of the class. I’ve got some more research to do, but for now I’m starting to figure out which wheels I am going to run on the car. I’ll be running in a street tire class, limited in the treadwear rating and size (width). Tire choice will be left up to another blog post all together. I’m not making a sure decision on wheels just yet, but here’s what I am currently thinking. When I ran my 2003 350z in BStock I ran a 17” Enkei RPF1 wheels, (here’s a photo). I was limited back then in that I had to run the same size wheels as came from the factory, in STR I won’t be limited to that requirement, but there is a limit as to the max width allowed in the class, 9”. I was thinking I would likely try to get 17” wheels again, but this time in the 9” width, today however Nick put it in my head that I should look at 18” wheels. the downfall of 18” wheels would be that they are likely going to be heavier than the same wheel in a 17”, but the benefit might be that they would have a taller tire/wheel combo, potentially helping to put more power down. The 350z likely, even in somewhat stock form, won’t have too little power, probably the most power in the class. If I do decide to go with 18” wheels, that’ll unfortunately cost more from a tire perspective, and also more for the wheels, but the advantages may outweigh the disadvantages. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find the proper size (18”x9”) in the Enkei RPF1s, though I wouldn’t mind those wheels again. They are nice and light weight, which is definitely something I need to be concerned with in the heavy 350z. I’m not going to be buying for a couple weeks, if that soon, but I’m definitely going to spend some more time looking at wheel options. "

This is a street tire class, meaning 140 treadwear or greater, which differs from the Stock Classes, which technically run “street legal” tires, but are often treadwear 50 or less. STR also allows for a number of other modifications, over time I’m going to be slowly prepping the car for the class, hopefully finalizing everything by the end of the autocross year, in time for Nationals in Lincoln, Nebraska. As I blog about the prep work for the car I’ll tag the posts with STR I’ve started by reading a couple of threads over on that website I used to manage, SCCAForums. com. The first is a thread from “NelsonI”, it has input from a number of different people, some you can trust, some you can’t, but generally good feedback. I’ll start blogging over the next few months about the some of the aspects of that post, and what I decide with the various parts and setup for the car.

I ended up not getting  it repaired, it was actually going to cost just less than we originally paid for it, so instead, we traded it in tonight! Woot! I’m back in autocross mode with a 2004 Nissan 350Z Enthusiast, and here she is.  You might think, hey, wait a minute, isn’t that the same car you had back when? Well, not quite. My previous 350z was a 2003 Enthusiast. What’s the difference? Well between 2k3 and 2k4, not much, 2k4 I believe is less buggy, the only physical  difference i know of is that the 2004 has pads next to your leg on the center console, and a power plug under the passenger side of the dashboard. Now, the differences between my old 2003 and my new 2004, here they are (differences as of time of purchase of the 2004, and time of sale of the 2003).             2003            2004                                      Koni Double Adjustable Shocks          Custom Swaybar          17  OEM Wheels          NISMO X-pipe          Custom trailer hitch                                      18  OEM Wheels from a Performance Model          Injen Super SES Exhaust          Pioneer Stereo, custom subwoofers and amplifier          Unknown carbon fiber front splitter          Unknown carbon fiber rear spoiler          Carbon fiber accents in Engine bay                    So what comes next?

I’m going to try to go over the car thoroughly tomorrow in the garage,  see if there are any other custom parts I don’t know about. At some point in the coming weeks I’ll come up with a list of things I need to get done to the car before the full blown autocross season starts up. Also tomorrow I’ve got a guy coming to take a look at the Project240z. I would like to keep that, but I know I shouldn’t, I won’t ever get it finished, especially now that I have  this 350z!

I had a little incident with the #projectquattro a few weeks ago, which also has spurred along the motivation to get a 350z. I’ve been monitoring Craigslist here locally for a while now, and it appears that there is a wide variety of 350zs available here around Denver right now. We went north about an hour this afternoon to check out one in particular. Check out the photos that I took of the car. It’s a 2004 Enthusiast model, with an Injen SES Exhaust, a Nismo short shifter, 18” wheels off a Performance model and a few other mods. Because it was Sunday we didn’t get to look in the car, except through the windows, or under the hood. I’m hoping to possibly drive back up there one evening this week to take a look and test drive of the car. To speed up the purchasing process I’m hoping to get rid of the 240z soon, if you’re interested in a 1973 Datsun 240z check out the site! I’ll be updating the website here over the next couple weeks as hopefully things ramp up! "

    "body": "2010/01/03 - THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD, NO LONGER AVAILABLE So I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around. Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to sell it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I wait to see if it sells, and then who knows what will happen after that. At this point in time I’m not looking to part the car out, that might change in the future, but for now I’ll keep from parting it out.  Basics:  Price: $1750 with all the spare parts (storage bins full), $1250 with the car as it currently sits. (add $250 to clean up title) Year: 1973 Make: Datsun Model: 240z Title: None (can be acquired at additional cost) Mileage: Unknown Location: Parker, Colorado (delivery available at $1. 25/mile up to 500 miles from Parker, CO) Thoughts: Depending on the needs, I can get the title cleared up on this car. I have a California title from a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it titled in my name. It is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars to get the title in my name due to fees, if the purchaser needs a title we can have this done. Engine:  L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2 Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all there.  Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently dumps under the driver Thoughts: The motor runs, though it is a tad picky to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of the manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment, knowledge I just don’t have. Transmission:  5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings on transmission mount.  Thoughts: Transmission works great as far as I know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and also drove fine with the previous motor in this car. Fuel System:  Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell Pump: High Pressure Pump (from Jegs) Lines: Stainless steel primarily 8AN Rail: Custom aluminum rail from Lonewolf Performance Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr Pressure Regulator Thoughts: No known issues with the fuel system, everything works as it should. ECU:  Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune) MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3. 0 PCB MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods MSStim22-C LG-Wirebund LC-1 without gauge Thoughts: As far as I know everything works great with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I don’t know enough to properly tune everything. Suspension:  Stock 1973 240Z Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/ front/rear sway bars (spares not included for $1250) I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far have only put bushings into the steering coupler and the transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250 price) Thoughts: The suspension is something I intended to address after having the car together, painted, and running. Wheels/Tires:  Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires Thoughts: Nothing special hereInterior:  Seats: None Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not included at $1250) Carpet: None Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except for the dash area which was removed after paint.  Thoughts: The interior needs some love depending on your intentions. I had planned to put a cage in, but haven’t had it done. I had some Corbeau A4 seats in the car, on custom welded in mounts, but the seats were too tall. Putting in other seats may require some fabrication work. My intention was to put in a race seat. Body:  Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2 Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73 240z Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and painted.  Thoughts: Passenger floor pan had some rust, cut out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere, but I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The body definitely needs some love and a paint job to get the car cleaned up. The passenger door needs some adjustment, it doesn’t close easily but will shut and stay closed. Pictures and Video:  I posted a lot of pictures of the car that I took yesterday, you can see them on this Flickr Set. If you would like to see other photos of specific parts please let me know.  I also took a video of the car running yesterday, you can see it starts off rough, but once going doesn’t sound half bad. Video of the 240z RunningFinal Thoughts:  I am torn on selling the car, as you can see in the intro to this post. I’ve had it for three and a half years now, and I would love to have the time to finish it, but to be honest I haven’t had time over the past 3. 5 years, I don’t foresee having the time/motivation to do it anytime soon. I’m not going to part the car out, and if it doesn’t sell, perhaps i will find the time to do more on the car. I spent a few hours cleaning things up yesterday and renewed my motivation to want to work on the car, but still not enough to decide not to sell it. If you are interested looking at the car please use the contact form here on Project240z. com, the car is only available on the weekends to be looked at right now. The two domain names, www. project240z. com and www. 240z. net are not included in this sale, but may be available if someone is interested in those. "

    "body": "2009/10/24 - So I will start this post off staying this: I know nothing, I am a noob when it comes to the megasquirt, and tuning a fuel injection car (or a carb’d car for that matter). That being said, I think my megasquirt is giving the car too much fuel when it’s trying to start. I don’t know how to prove this, other than to learn how to mess with the fuel map for the megasquirt and see if I can’t back off the fuel a big when trying to start the car. The car doesn’t like to start, it’s very hesitant to do so, and to me it just sounds like it’s flooded and can’t ignite because of this. I’ll have to do some reading here over the next week or so to see if I can’t figure it out and get the car to reliably start. I did start to adjust the fuel map a bit this afternoon but ended up not getting enough juice from the battery to power the starter and the fuel pump at the same time, so I’ve got the battery on the charge. The charger has been getting a workout today as it was plugged into an 89 RX-7 for a few hours while I charged the battery on that ride up so it can be loaded on the transport truck later today (if the guy ever shows up). Earlier this week I did manage to get the datsun started, and even backed it out of the garage, but I couldn’t keep it running enough to drive it back in so I had to push it. I moved it over into the third bay so that I could make room for the F250 to park inside for the winter. That truck is huge, barely fits into our 24ft garage (we also have 18” shelves in front of it), but it does fit, so that made the wife exceptionally happy! I’ll try to get some new photos of the Datsun later this week. I may start doing some body work prep on it, I have a coupon for a maaco paint job for $275, so I think I’ll get some bondo out to smooth out some rough spots and get it ready for paint. Bondo? Maaco? I don’t see any value in putting a lot of money into the exterior of this Datsun at this point. I just need it to run, and not be 5 different colors, so I’ll take it to Maaco for a flat black paint job and be done with it! "

    "body": "2009/10/08 - So it’s been a while since I actually created a video of working on the car, that’s not to say I haven’t worked on the car, I ripped the dash out completely! That would have made a cool video, apologies for not being proactive enough to setup the camera. Anyways, I’m back working on the car, making progress, and hoping to make more progress this weekend getting it running. Yesterday I spent a few hours farting around with the electronics. After ripping out the dash I’ve been unable to get the car started, rather than continuing to try to make the stock ignition work I decided to just give up on that, and scrap the stock fuse block. I picked up a few fuse blocks from Napa a week or so ago, and yesterday started working on doing the wiring to use those blocks. The video isn’t all that entertaining, but I did come up with a cool angle towards the end of the video. I ended up not having the equipment I needed. I ordered more stuff last night and should have it tomorrow, so I can get working on the car this weekend. Now, check out the video! "

I’m a computer geek, but not always the best when it comes to working on the car, I question everything I do, maybe because I blew up the last motor? Part of the wiring problem I’ve had is that I needed to get a fuse block to start hooking things up to, the original block had melted long ago, and only half worked. Last night I went to PepBoys and CarToys looking to see if I could find anything, with no luck. Today I decided to try Napa, SCORE! I actually got two different blocks. One 6 pole and one 10 pole, that way I can break things up if necessary. I hope to get the wiring started this weekend, I would like to attempt to have the car running again, which I think really just means I need to get a switch wired for the starter. I’m not going to deal with a key for the car, this car long run isn’t going to be something someone will be able to walk up and start anyways. So we’ll see how far I get, I may also have to go look at this on Saturdayâ€¦. (link to welder removed) "

So in my last blog post I complained that I thought I left the fiberglass dashboard for the 240Z in St. Louis. Well I was wrong! Tonight while trying to get things moved around in the garage to make room for our two primary vehicles I was up on the loft moving things and came across the dashboard! So all is well again in Project240z. com land, well, as well as it can be! I was going to drive the car around the block tonight, and park it in the third car garage, but I quickly realized that wasn’t going to happen unless I wanted to take the wiring harness out of the old dash and hook up the wires. Right now the ignition wires aren’t going to anything, so that would make it kind of hard to start the car and drive it. Oh well, I moved it around a bit by hand and made room for one of our cars in the garage at least, the F350 will have to stay outside for a while longer. Hopefully by the end of September I’ll either have a new quieter exhaust on the car, or all the paint completely stripped off, or maybe even both! "

    "body": "2009/08/18 - So tonight after work I got the 240Z off the trailer, both of which had been parked in the Garage since we moved to Colorado a few weeks ago. I had lined up a storage lot for the trailer and wanted to get it out of the garage. Well the 240Z wasn’t easy to start, took a good 5+ minutes of attempts before it finally started up. Later in the day I realized the MAP hose wasn’t hooked up to the Megasquirt, that would explain the difficulty in starting! whoops. So I dropped the trailer off and came home to organize the garage a bit, moved the newly assembled shelves in place and started going through some of my boxes. After I got bored with the unpacking I decided it was a good time to put all the bulbs and fuses that I had purchased yesterday into the car. That was pretty quick and painless, but didn’t produce any fruit! I didn’t see any lights in the rear of the car at all. So what next? I simply decided to pull the dashboard out! The whole thing, gone, removed, not going back in (likely not) along with the blower and heater core. Why might you ask? Why not. The car will hopefully be somewhat streetable, but I won’t be using most of the gauges on the car anyways. For a speedo I’ll have the G2X (GPS data logging), for RPM I’ll likely have the G2X, or even a Netbook running the Megasquirt software to show me all the appropriate date from the ECU. So why do I need the stock dash? I don’t! Though I did realize after I pulled the dash that I left the fiberlass dashboard in St. Louis, and didn’t bring it to CO. Luckily I’m going back to STL next week for work and will hopefully get it packed up and shipped back. I’ll need to do some creative wiring, hooking up a switch for the headlights, a horn, turn signals, and even the ignition, but I think it will be cool to have all those as switchable items on a nice clean looking dashboard, not the big old clunky stock one.

It has been over 23 months since the car last moved under it’s own power, so getting it out of the driveway (harder than it sounds) and driving it around the circle made for a great day. The car is still hard to start, but once it starts up the first time it generally starts up easier (as you will see in the video). I then had trouble trying to get into gear, keep the car running, and letting off the brake as the ebrake isn’t strong enough to keep it at the top of our driveway. I finally just let the car roll down the driveway and started it at the bottom before driving it around. If you want to see it running and driving skip ahead in the video to around 6 minutes. Commentary provided by my beautiful wife Natalie. The video is in HD, so watch it that way ;) https://www. youtube. com/v/pbd7GbTyAiU After driving it around I even got more of the front end put together, with a grill and air dam installed, I’ll get a picture of that configuration tomorrow.

I’m going to try to get rid of all the extra parts I have in the next week or two, and a hatch is one of the extras so I wanted to get the one off the car. That process went pretty quickly, and here are the results:  The blue one being the one I will be getting rid of, and the brown one being the one I want to put on the car. After that I started playing around with some paint stripper. Here’s the result of that.  I don’t think I want to buy enough stripper to spray down the whole car!

    "body": "2009/06/10 - With the success last night I decided I had to work on the car this evening a bit. The first thing I did was get it up on all four jack stands so that they were under the frame and not under control arms of the car. This would allow me to begin working on the suspension pieces. When I got the car from Jeff, uhhh over three years ago now, it came with a second suspension that had been pulled off another car. This other suspension has springs (yellow), new(er) struts, a larger front sway bar, and also the addition of a rear sway bar. It also is a lot cleaner then the current suspension. So tonight I started pulling off the front suspension, starting with the sway bar, and moving on to removing the rest, at least what I could, of the right front. I got stuck at the tie rod, but I did manage to get most of the other bolts removed. I came to a conclusion though, I’m going to likely just drop the whole front suspension out, including the cross member as the second suspension has one as well. In order to do that though I am going to have to dismount the motor. I will attempt to do that by lifting the motor up off the mounts with the cherry picker, hopefully without having to disconnect the transmission and not removing the whole thing from the car. Before I do that though I will likely fully disassemble the other suspension and take it to a friend’s house to sandblast everything. I’m heading to Tampa for a conference tomorrow, so that will have to wait until the evenings next week. I’ll try to get everything disassembled during the week, both front and rear suspensions, and then probably go down to his place Saturday if he’ll be around. "

So the last starter started off working, but after a few days just started spinning without engaging the flywheel, no grinding either. This one, once all wired up worked like a champ. I even got the car started up for a minute or so. I did all this without hooking up the computer, so I didn’t want to spend too much time keeping it running.

    "body": "2009/05/29 - So last night after work I came home with the intention of trying to figure out why the car wouldn’t start. My intentions were to check the positioning of the 36-1 wheel for the VR sensor that drives the Megasquirt/EDIS setup. After checking the positioning of the sensor I was going to do a compression check on the motor. Well I threw those intentions out of the window, I wanted to see if after charging the battery the night before things would be better as the changes from the night before were not completely tested due to the drained battery. Well wouldn’t you know, the car started! And not just once, but twice! It actually even ran for a bit, assuming I had my foot on the pedal, otherwise it would die, but that didn’t concern me, not yet. So it ran, and I have megasquirt log files to prove it! I went to try to start it again, and got nothing, but this time it wasn’t timing, it wasn’t motor, it was the starter. The starter wouldn’t turn over, it would only click, which made things really weird because I hadn’t had that problem before. Rather than trying to make it work I simply decided to pull the starter out of the car and check it out, it looked okay.  I decided I would take a picture of the flywheel, and as soon as I took a picture I noticed something shining off the flash.  As soon as I took a second look at it I knew exactly what it was. Here’s a photo of it after I pulled it from the flywheel.  Want to know what that is? That is one of the three missing screws from the starter when it fell apart a few weeks ago So with that revelation I decided that I would call it a night from trying to make the car run. I worked on cleaning up some things in the garage, I need to get it up on jack stands and find the remaining 2 screws which I believe are also still in the bell housing. Perhaps this weekend, or early next week I’ll get it up and find them. I also started disassembling the old block, crank and pistons as I need to get rid of those here soon, especially if we find out about our home offer soon (https://www. going2colorado. com) Here’s a brief video of today’s work, nothing too fascinating, next time I have it running I’ll get audio!

Terec came over and helped me out for a bit as well. The first thing I checked was to see what the starter looked like, I was worried based on the noises that I’ve been hearing that the newly installed starter was bad. Well I pulled it out, it looked fine, as did the flywheel itself, so there went that theory. I put the started back on the car and connected the wires. From there I attempted to start the car again. The grinding happened a bit, but I swear it doesn’t last, and even got less frequent as the night wore on. Terec showed up as i was attempting to start the car. We spent most of the evening trying multiple things, rewiring the VR sensor for the megasquirt was the main thing. I attempted it multiple ways, running some new wires for the sensor, and trying different combinations of connections on the wires. At the end of the night we really didn’t seem to get anywhere. Throwing the timing light on the car it does appear to be close to the correct timing, though I need to find TDC again tomorrow night and check to make sure that the VR sensor is 60 degrees from the missing tooth on the wheel. The last attempt at starting the car seemed to only get 100rpm from the starter, so we assume that the battery was drained a bit too much. Because of that we threw it on the charger and called it a night. Another thing that just struck me, I need to check the compression on the motor tomorrow, that hasn’t been done :( "

    "body": "2009/05/04 - So I spoke with my Megasquirt Guru last week a few times, and again this weekend, and even had him show up in my driveway to help wrench on the car today! So yesterday I got up and checked to see if the 36-1 wheel for the Megasquirt (using Ford EDIS) was correctly mounted, meaning, should the mounting have changed due to moving from the 1983 motor, to the 1978 motor. I removed the radiator in order to get to the front of the motor, draining it out was probably a good idea. We had put water in last weekend when getting things ready to start, well the water was pretty darn rusty and dirty when I took it out yesterday, probably need to do that a few more times just to make sure everything gets flushed from the radiator (sitting for 2 years) and the block, which has been sitting for 6 or more years (2+ since it last ran, longer since it actually was used much). After getting the radiator out of the way I was able to confirm that TDC on the 78 motor is the same as the 83 motor, which makes things easier, I don’t have to have the pulley and 36-1 wheel modified, but it didn’t get me any closer to figuring out why I can’t get the car started. I ended up bring in the Megasquirt inside so I could hook it up to my Stim and the laptop to figure out if I could see why I was getting a weird RPM signal from it when the computer was hooked up. I wasn’t able to do much there either, but Andy Whittle told me to bring the squirt and the Laptop over to his house on Sunday and he would help me out. Natalie and I went to the gun range, and afterward I had a voicemail from Andy, he was on the way up to my house, talk about service! Andy and I spent a few hours in the garage working on things. We ended up figuring out that the squirt/stim worked fine on his laptop, which meant that it was a software or hardware issue on my laptop, not the megasquirt. From there he adjusted the fuel map quite a bit, we seemed to be flooding the motor so we dropped a lot of fuel, took all the plugs out and cranked it, trying to get fuel out if it was truly flooded, not much came out. All in all we weren’t too successful, but we did get it to almost fire up a few times. A few times we got some nice big backfires, once enough that pressure came up through one of the cutouts in the driver’s side floorboard, enough to make my foot jump off the floor. I ended up removing the VR sensor from the 36-1 wheel at Andy’s suggestion and installed a new one, though the plug is backwards on it, so later this week I’ll try it out again, as well as try rewiring the sensor. These sensors are very picky, so we’re not sure if that’s the problem, or something else, but hopefully rewiring it will correct it and the car will start up! Hopefully right? :D Huge thanks to Whittle for the help today. "

I put the single belt in place, and also hooked up the EDIS trigger on the 36-1 wheel for the megasquirt setup. I also put the throttlebody and the intake to the turbo back on the car. I put the battery onto the charger so that it’ll be ready to go Saturday. The more I mess with that thing the more I realize I need to get that moved to the back of the car soon after the car runs again, rather than having it sitting up in the engine bay taking up valuable room. I’ll probably do a few more of these minor buttoning up items tomorrow and Thursday night, leaving for tasks like the radiator and coolant, along with other minor things, for Saturday when Dave and possibly Terec are over to assist.

We spent a couple hours this morning and were able to get the engine and transmission into the car, it all worked out pretty well with the only hitch being that all the transmission fluid I put in, came back out :D After that we hooked up the drive shaft, clutch line, and the speedo cable (which last time the car ran didn’t work anyways). We took a break to go get a rental car for my trip to Indianapolis in the morning. After returning home I drained the fuel cell of the gas that unfortunately has been in there since August 2007 when the car last ran. I barely had enough gas cans to drain it fully, though I did have to put some of the cans into the rental carâ€¦ I figured out how to safely burn off old fuel though :D Here are some pictures   and of course the video!

    "body": "2009/04/19 - So I had hoped to get the engine installed into the car today but got sidetracked trying to get a final few items finished up before doing so. First things first I wanted to try and get some of the new bushings I purchased off Ebay back in December into the car, so I attempted to get the old bushings out of the rear motor mount, not having much luck I went to Carquest. They also didn’t have any luck but sent me on to Terry’s Machine Shop in Bridgeton. 25 minutes or so later (which was 20 minutes after they closed) the old bushings were free and room for the new urethane bushings available. I then ran back to Carquest and picked up some lithium grease and headed home. I painted the rear motor mount one last time, as playing around with the bushings had removed some paint, and then I started on other items. I changed the bushing in the steering coupler to use the new urethane bushing, I also spent some time cleaning up some of the dust, and crap in the engine back from 2yrs ago when the car last ran. After doing this I drained the transmission and checked to see if I had any fluid to put back in it before installing it in the car tomorrow, I didn’t so I picked some up tonight. I assembled the new bushings in the rear mount and then test fitted it under the car to make sure it would work, success, so hopefully it goes in smoothly tomorrow. So I didn’t get a whole lot of progress made today, but I hope to tomorrow as Terec will be coming over in the morning and helping me with the big task, getting the motor up and into the car, 6 bolts should be all it takes! Then it’ll probably take me all week to hook up all the wires and lines to it, hopefully I’ll be able to try and crank it over next week. Here’s the video from today, not much "

I then started working around the garage, I didn’t shoot too much video today because I wasn’t doing too much interesting when I wasn’t working on the motor. I took the oil pan off to make sure I drained any water from the block due to my impromptu cleaning yesterday. I also put two items on the motor, the thermo stat and one of the inlet/outlets for the coolant. I would have done more but I ran into a problem today. I can’t seem to locate the baggy of all the manifold parts from when I removed the intake/exhaust from the other motor. I found pretty much every other part I could need for the motor except for this bag.

    "body": "2008/10/25 - So my weekend of working on the 240Z started off quite slowly today. I ended up sleeping until almost noon this morning, it was nice to catch up on some much lost rest from the travelling the past few months. So after my restful morning I had a few errands to run to get my costume ready for a party tonight. Once those were completed I was able to spend some time in the garage. First things first getting the months of piled on crap off the top of the car. That led me to assembling the 2nd craftsman stool that I had purchased probably 10 months ago now, it was in a box on the hood of the car. Once I could see the top of the car I made room at the back and rolled her back a bit in the garage, this allowed me to get to the motor which has been on the stand for quite some time sitting in front of the car. Without the Corvette in the garage (sheds a small tear) I had plenty of room to move the motor over to the free side of the garage to work on. The next step for the car is to get all of the motor bits back together, the manifolds, turbo and all other accessories need to be put on the car so that I can put it back in the engine bay. I spent some time this afternoon cleaning off some more of the grease/dirt that covers the motor. I think Lynn, the previous owner, took it to a rally cross based on all the dirt and grime I’ve pulled off this motor over time. I didn’t get too far today, but I hope that tomorrow I can get all of the parts back on the motor, if I can successfully do that I should be able to get the motor back in the car next weekend. The biggest problem I have working on the car is staying focused, if I’m by myself I tend to stray from the task at hand, and I never seem to get anything done. Case in point today, at some point while working on clearing off the car I got out the angle grinder and wire wheeled the hole where the FM antenna was at one point, I thought it looked like it might be rusting so I took the paint off then sprayed some primer on the car. Now it looks worse than before, but I had fun! :) More updates tomorrow, hopefully with some video. I tried using the Chase Cam today to shoot some video but apparently the PDR doesn’t really care for normal AA batteries as it only stayed powered on for about 5 minutes before shutting off, without me knowing.

So far things look good, though we could see quite a bit of crap sitting above the valves, mostly dead bugs and such. I tried to get them out with a combination of the air compressor and a shop vac, tomorrow I’ll know if it worked. We also removed the oil pan and made sure things down there were alright. We’ll check the torque on bolts tomorrow and then put the oil pan from the Turbo motor back on. One thing I noticed, the 78 L28E has round exhaust ports while the 83 L28ET that died had square, so I’ll have to do some research and see if the intake/exhaust manifolds should work on that 78 head or not. My plan was to take the turbo/exhaust setup from the 83 and put it onto the 78, hopefully tomorrow. Other than that, we tried replacing the rear main seal, though I think the one we put in will probably leak more than the one we took out so I’ve ordered another one. We did all this with the motor on the engine stand which limited our access to the seal, when I have the motor back up on the cherry picker we’ll replace the seal before attaching the flywheel and transmission.

After breaking a bolt off in the head trying to get one of the mounts setup for the cherry picker we managed to get the motor up and off the ground, though it took a couple of tries because we tried to get by with “the wrong” parts, meaning bolts in the chain that were too small for what we were doing. Lesson learned, again, use the right damn tools, instead of trying to make the wrong tools work. You’ll save time rather than trying to take short cuts. Once we had the motor up on the stand he headed home to work on this car and I started trying to get the motor cleaned up a bit. Here are two before shots, of the front of the motor just caked in dirt and crap.  After spraying it down with degreaser and scrubbing with a wire brush I decided to finish what I started yesterday and remove the manfolds from the side of the motor. That actually went fairly easily, I’m not sure why, perhaps loading up the bolts with WD-40 yesterday before I finished helped, some of them almost seemed loose before I even cranked on them, perhaps Eric or I started to remove them last year when working on the other motor? After getting the manifolds off I took off the last remaining attached item to the side of the motor, but honestly, I’m not sure what it was? At first I assumed it was a power steering pump, but the more I think about it the more I think it might have been the AC compressor? After that I tried to spend some time organizing the garage a bit. I managed to get a few things hung up on the wall and made more room in there for the Corvette. I’ve still yet to make enough room to bring the 240Z home from storage. I don’t think I’ll be able to park both cars in the garage until I have the motor in the 240, otherwise I’ll never have room in there for both cars and the motor, plus transmissions. Speaking of transmissions, I need to sell the 2 extra ones I have, if anyone is looking for an automatic transmission out of a 73 240Z, or a 5 speed out of a 280Z let me know. I was told the 5 speed needs rebuilding, I have no clue about it other than that. My goal/plan right now is to tear down the L28E and check things over, replace the rear main seal, make sure to clean it out, then try and put it all back together. I don’t imagine I’ll get that done before May, but I would like to spend time on it over the next few weeks if I can. "

    "body": "2008/03/09 - Today Nick and I ran around town, getting some metal for his 240Z, then around to find a few other supplies that he needed. When I got home I was half motivated to work on the car! So I went out to the garage, after sitting on the couch for 30 minutes, and got to working. It’s still cold here in St. Louis so I had the garage door closed and decided to plug the space heater in to warm it up a little bit. I put together a little rolling stool that I purchased from Sears a few weeks back (please don’t visit www. slickdeals. net, that site will make you spend more money at Sears than you ever have before). After putting the stool together I decided I should get to work on the motor. What motor? This motor is out of a 78 280Z 2+2. The parts car, it ran when I got it, so the plan right now is to transfer the turbo/intake/fuel system from the blown 83 motor to this motor. So I started on the motor, working on taking the fuel rail off the motor, along with the injectors and such (all this will be for sale later this week). I had most everything removed so that I could pull the fuel rail and injectors when I found one hose that was still hooked up to the intake manifold. Being that the motor is 30 years old some of the hoses and clamps are a little hard to remove, easy enough fix, I got a pair of dykes and started cutting. Out pours some gasoline, which I found odd that there was still any fuel in the system. A few moments later when more fuel poured out I realized that the space heater was sitting less than 2 feet from where the fuel was hitting the floor. Talk about getting your heart rate going, I jumped, grabbed the space heater and lifted it off the ground, quickly unplugging it and removing it from the area. Thankfully nothing caught fire! That would of sucked! More work tomorrow, I’m going to try and get the motor up on an engine stand so I can replace the rear main seal which leaks, and try to check everything over before I put it all back together. I could “possibly” have this motor running by the end of the month in the car. But I know how lazy and busy I am, so I have no doubts that there is no way I’ll get all that done :) More info and pictures tomorrow, possibly even a new 240Z video! "

Here’s the first one, this is NOT ALL of the parts, there are still parts in the motor that may never come out.  At first I thought I found a nut, and that was the culprit of the whole mess. I don’t believe that to be the case, I believe the nuts/bolts connecting the rod to the crankshaft came free, though, perhaps that was the problem, maybe they were lose? I’m going to save this piece, and perhaps attach it to my office door at work.  Plenty more pictures in the Project240Z Set on Flickr UPDATE here’s a link to tonight’s video. "

Next step after that, start to take apart the L28E motor sitting on the floor. It’s been sitting for almost a year now, and I’ve learned my lesson about not taking a look at what you have (see previous “First step” above). So I hope to get the L28E motor somewhat apart so that I can replace the seals on it, and hopefully see what shape it is in. I’d hate to put a bunch of time into it only to find it’s toast already. I know it ran, I drove the car it came out of, and I’m sure Lynn took good care of it, but I should really take some time with the motor this time so I don’t get 40 seconds of time out of it! Now, to be fair, the old motor ran for probably a good 25 to 30 minutes total. It just got to drive for about 5 minutes, and 40 seconds of an autocross run. (Why oh why didn’t I have the wife shooting Video instead of pictures?) Nick, if you’re reading this and you aren’t working all weekend I hope to see you and the new friend over here this weekend!

I didn’t place as high as I would have hoped in the Collins’ Solstice, but I had a blast nonetheless. While out there Nick Jackson and I did a lot of soul searching. We’ve been talking for the past few weeks about what to do with the Project240z, here are a few of the options we’ve discussed. 123456- Buy an LS1 and drop it in and continue to run in XP- Buy a 5. 3 Vortec out of a Tahoe and continue to run in XP- Drop in the 78 280Z motor in the garage and run FP- Sell the car and buy one of the following to run  - C5 Z06 to run in SS  - 06+ Mustang GT to run in FSWell, I think option 4. 1 is leading the pack right now. Though my goal is to have the 240Z running by the end of October. My plan is to pull the bad motor out of the car tomorrow, and start replacing the leaky seal in the motor out of the 78 parts car. Get the 78 motor together, fuel injection setup off the Turbo motor, possibly the turbo, intake and exhaust over as well. Install the 78 in the car, get the car running, paint the car, sell the car. We’ll see where I end up, but I’m definitely keeping my options open. "

I was going to take the valve cover off and see if I saw anything out of the ordinary, then pull the head if I could get to that. Before doing those two things though I figured I should drain the oil out of the motor. Much to my suprise when I drained the oil it wasn’t oil that came out first, it was coolant, then oil followed.  Once I discovered that I began to lose hope that I would be able to salvage anything in this motor. Thoughts of a cracked block filled my head. Nevertheless I proceeded forward with removing the valve cover and whatever else I could get to. When I pulled the cover off I started looking around and immediately found something that looked out of place. Ends up I found two things out of place, two of the rocket arm guides were laying on the cylinder, with a little Matlock work I found that both the guides from the #2 cylinder were not in the correct place.  From there I didn’t get too far, I did get the timing sprocket and chain removed, and ended up getting the camshaft remove as well, but I was unable to see anything out of the ordinary. I even tried sticking a magnet into the spark plug hole on the #2 cylinder with hopes of pulling some bits of metal out of there, hoping to find something awry. No dice, so I’ll have to wait until this weekend to get further on the investigation. I’m going to have to pull the motor out of the car in order to take the manifolds off so that I can remove the cylinder head and see what happened on Sunday.

I basically didn’t touch the car until Thursday, and all I did then was take a few minutes to inaccurately measure the requirements for the flange on the downpipe. Friday I picked up a header collector flange from my buddy Russ’ place. Sunday morning I went to work on that flange, it needed some help to make it fit. Sunday afternoon I spent some time in the sauna, I mean garage. I managed to get the coil pack and EDIS module mounted to the fender. I then started trying to clean up some of the wiring in the engine bay. I got some plastic loom a while back so I started running that to cover up the mess of wiring in the engine bay. I also ran the loom in the passenger compartment around some of the wiring in there. It’s not finished, but it’s definitely starting to look better. Dad helped me to put a switch inline for the main relay. Luckily with the car not idling yet I haven’t had problems turning the car off, but with the way things were wired if the car was idling properly you’d have to pull a fuse or disconnect the battery to shut off the car. Now that I have a switch it’s easy to do! After that Dad and I put the hood and hinges on the car, the first time since I’ve owned the 240 that it has had a hood attached! From there we loaded the car up onto the trailer later in the evening. This morning I got up early (a rarity for me) and took the car/trailer over to the Carx on St. Charles Rock Road in Bridgeton. Rick was extremely helpful over there and by 12pm today I was back up there loading the car up on the trailer with Eric’s help. Carx put a 3” pipe from the downpipe back to the rear axle, with a turndown on the end. It’s still quite loud, but if I do say so myself, it sounds pretty damn sweet! Eric and I brought the car home, and before trying to push it off the trailer I finally got it started. I’m having starter issues and will probably try to replace the starter Thursday or Friday of this week. I drove the car off the trailer and into the garage, it’s a beautiful sound! I’m still aiming to compete drive the car at the Autocross on Sunday. Before I can do that I have quite a bit left to do.  Fix the idle (longer idle screw) See if there’s any fluid in the transmission (can’t get the fill plug out so I’ve not pulled the drain plug yet) Build a bulkhead/firewall for the fuel cell Finish up wiring for the O2 sensor Get a harness squared away More stuff I’m sure I’ve forgotten!"

    "body": "2007/07/28 - This morning I woke up with a little hope in my eye, hope that I would make some good progress today. After doing some reading online about the Megasquirt and EDIS, I headed out to the garage. The first thing I noticed was that the coil pack wasn’t plugged into the EDIS module. I’m not sure if I had unplugged it last night when trying to figure out why we didn’t have any spark, or if I hadn’t plugged it in at all last night. I then hooked up the laptop and tried to start the car, to see if anything changed. At first, nothing was different than last night, no spark and no RPM signal on the squirt. But a few tries later, I noticed the RPM on the laptop jumped up. Sporadically I was able to get RPM but nothing consistent or worth a darn from a starting perspective. I decided from there I would need to mount the coil pack and the EDIS module as I hadn’t mounted them yet, they were just laying in the car. To do that I needed to pick up some metal as I didn’t have enough to fabricate much. I headed out around noon to the DMV, it was time to get the trailer registered, and then head to Illinois to pick up the trailer, fix the wiring on the trailer, and then hit Home Depot on the way home to pick up the metal. The trailer pickup took far longer than I expected, but with the help of Andy and Chris Hohl, I was able to get the wiring on the trailer fixed! When I got home I backed the trailer into the driveway and got to work on the car again. Before I went ahead and started building brackets for the EDIS setup, I decided to try and rewire the VR sensor on the car, to see if that might fix my problems. I checked a few things I had lying around. I had a VR sensor for a V6 Ford Explorer, but I was using the VR sensor that matched the 36-1 wheel off a 4Cylinder Escort that I had mounted to the car. I checked the wiring on both sensors and noticed that the colors were opposite on the Explorer plug. After swapping out the VR sensor wires, I went to fire the car up, sure enough, I had a full RPM signal on the laptop! Score! I then started checking to see if I had any spark. Eric showed up and we weren’t getting any spark. To try something out, we plugged in the other coil pack and hooked up one wire/plug sitting on top of the valve cover. Once we did this, we immediately noticed spark! Score again! Just to see if we had something else wrong, we plugged back into the original coil pack, and sure enough, this one also sparked. One thing we did to the original coil pack was to run a wire from one of the mounting points to the shock tower on the passenger side. I’m not exactly sure what changed to cause us to start getting a spark, but I think it most likely related to this ground, perhaps, I’ll test it out again tomorrow without the ground and see what happens. Once we had spark, we hooked the fuel pump back up and tried to get her to fire. First thing we started getting was a few pops and then lots of smoke! Score again! After a few attempts, we decided we’d tried enough for the time being. Eric headed out and I decided I needed to try something else. I remembered reading today that the EDIS coil pack should run 132, and we had plugged in the wires for 123, so I swapped this around. As soon as I attempted to start it was a totally different sound, it was beautiful! I’ve not yet gotten it to start, but it sure sounds like it’s trying to. I had Andy Whittle on the phone throughout the night and I sent him a few log files from the data I recorded while trying to start the motor. Around 10pm I figured it was probably a little too late to try to keep starting the car with all the noise it was creating. I got under the car and hooked up the speedometer cable, put the missing bushings into the transmission crossmember, and tightened that up as well as the clutch slave cylinder. I’ve got a few things to try in the morning before I head off to the muffler shop to see if I can’t get an exhaust put on the car. Here’s some video from tonight, trying to start the car. "

When I got home this evening the first thing I did was check to see if the new fitting would be what I needed. I put the fitting into the rail with some teflon and hooked everything up. I pressurized the fuel system, and sure enough, it was leaking fuel again! Not a happy camper was I. With a leaking fuel rail I couldn’t do much else so I called up Speed Sports to see if they could help me out by tapping the rail and selling me a new fitting. They were running a little late and not open yet so I decided to work on the power issue we were having with the Megasquirt. On Tuesday we had problems because the MS signal to the laptop was highly unsteady. We weren’t sure if it was a power problem, or if it was related to a bad ground. Tonight I replaced the wire we were running to the main relay with a direct line from the battery.  Once I did this the relay kicks in immediately when plugged to the battery, powering up the megasquirt without the ignition being on. This corrected the fluctuation issue, which was great news! Now that the gauges and sensors seem to work fuel was the last major hurdle before I could attempt to start the car. I headed up to Speed Sports and had Lou tap the rail and install a new fitting for me. He showed me that I wasn’t using enough teflon on the fitting, and he also managed to run the fitting nearly all the way in, where we were only able to get it in a few threads before. Once I had the new fitting installed I was starting to get excited, perhaps it would hold and I’d be able to see what happens when I cranked the car.  Installation of the rail was easy, I’ve installed and removed it so much in the past two nights that it is easy to do now. Eric showed up and we pressurized the fuel system a few times. All tests appeared good, no fuel leaking out anywhere! Now it was time, the power was good, the fuel was good, it was time to try and start the car. Eric and I tied up a few last minute things, hooked up the battery, computer to the Megasquirt and watched all the gauges on the PC light up. Eric stood by the front of the car with a fire extinguisher and I reached into the driver’s door to turn the key. I turned the key, she cranked over, a beautiful sound I must say. After a few cranks I realized the fuel pump wasn’t running, which meant that the squirt wasn’t getting an RPM signal as it should be. I looked over at the display and sure enough, no RPMs registering on the PC. Without RPMs the Megasquirt won’t allow the fuel pump to run for more than 2 seconds, that was my giveaway. I called Whittle up and he suggested a few things. First thing was to pull a spark plug and see if we were getting any spark. Nothing. Then I checked to make sure the EDIS was getting power, it was. So that’s where I’m at right now. I’ve got a bit to do tomorrow, I need to diagnose why I’m not getting spark. I’ll check a few things first, see if perhaps the VR sensor is wired backwards, which would cause this. I’ll also check to make sure I have the VR sensor in the correct location. I’m taking off from work tomorrow to try and finish things up on the car this weekend so I can race on Sunday. We’ll see if I reach my goal! Overall I was very pleased with the progress tonight, even if the car didn’t start I gave it a shot, turned it over and everything seems to work minus the spark issue. We’ll see how things go tomorrow and I’ll post video from tonight’s attempt and hopefully tomorrow’s success. "

    "body": "2007/07/27 - Well, Wednesday night was an eventful night. When I got home from work I jumped under the car and tried to track down my coolant leak. I found small traces of coolant here and there, but I didn’t find any big problems. While under the car I found a few other things. I noticed that the oil return line off the bottom of the turbo wasn’t hooked up. Thankfully I found that, had I tried to start the car with that disconnected we would of had a real mess on our hands. I found the coolant leak I was looking for, it, like the first coolant leak we found on Tuesday night, was in the thermostat housing. There was a plug in the housing that hadn’t been covered in teflon and hadn’t been tightened down enough either. After that I started to hookup the vacuum lines for the wastegate to the turbo. Once I had finished under the car I decided it was time to track down the fuel leak in the rail. We initially though that the first 3 injectors were leaking on the rail, so I spent an hour notching the fuel rail brackets so that I could lower the rail close to the intake manifold more, adjusting the angle of the injectors. This ended up not being the cause of the leak, but I do believe that the angle of the injectors is now much better than before as they sit in the rail and intake much better now. The cause of the fuel leak ended up being the 45 degree fitting we had on the inlet end of the rail. When removing the fitting on the rail I found that both the threads on the fitting and the rail were bunged up really good. There was no reusing the fitting so I would have to get another one and retap the rail. "

    "body": "2007/07/25 - Fuel leaks, coolant leaks, and blown fuses. That about sums up the evening… First off, a HUGE thanks to everyone who came over tonight. Henry, Ronnie, Terec, Ian, Eric, Scott, and Andy, without you guys helping out I wouldn’t have gotten anything done tonight! Here’s a basic summary of how things went tonight. Henry and Ronnie showed up first and got to work on finishing the wiring in the engine bay. They by far did the most, if not all of the work on the wiring on the car, I had put together three wires, but they as a team cranked through some things, far faster than I could ever hope to. While they spent time working on the wiring in the engine bay I did a little work in the passenger compartment trying to get some wires run, finding parts for them, and trying to close up some ports on the intake before the turbo but after the MAF. Before heading to the interior to do wiring Henry, Ronnie, and I attempted to crank the starter, to see if it would fire. Because this car is now a manual, but originally was an auto Ronnie wired up a relay to bypass the neutral safety switch that keeps the starter from firing if the car isn’t in park. We were unable to locate the stock relay but found some of the wiring so we just ended up bypassing the whole thing. When they were working on the interior wiring I finished up some of the engine mount bolts that needed tightening and started cleaning up the Ford plug wires that I had picked up from the junkyard a while back. The rest of the guys started showing up, when Whittle called me I told him we were about half an hour from trying to start the car, he’s the Megasquirt Guru so I asked him to come over and assist us with things while we tried. By the time he arrived we weren’t quite ready, but we thought we were close. Once the Whittle’s showed up we ran some fuel through the fuel system into a jug (rather than the fuel rail) to try and clean out the hoses and pump, to keep any buildup from getting into the rail and injectors. That testing went fine, but as soon as we hooked the fuel lines back up and sent some pressure through the system we found a few leaks. The fittings at the fuel filter in the engine bay had been put together without Teflon, lesson learned, 10 minutes later it was all back together again and pressure testing started up. Then we found a bigger issue, but one that didn’t dump near as much fuel out. We can’t seem to get the injector for the number 1 cylinder sealed into the fuel rail, it looks like the 2 and 3 injectors are also leaking a bit. So, tomorrow, the fuel rail will come off and we’ll try to make adjustments. On the electrical side of things: At first, we couldn’t get the MS to fire up at all with the power from the car. After about 15 minutes, and Whittle about to give up I started looking for wires and remembered, we ran the TPS and TPS Signal wires, but don’t currently have a TPS to hook up to, well sure enough, they were sitting right on the intake manifold. As soon as I removed them the Squirt fired up in Megatune. Then there were a few other gremlins. The MS seemed to be getting power spikes, though not completely resetting itself and firing the fuel pump again. At first, we thought this was a grounding issue, but I believe I’ve now tracked it down just to be a source issue. While trying to track that down we started blowing fuses in the stock wiring. We couldn’t figure out why that was happening until I looked at what we had wired into for the switched power line. I found that we were jumped into a line for the AC, well two days ago I pulled the AC system from under the dash and the wiring was still there, half hanging out of the car, which of course was touching the chassis, and causing our problem. Once I figured that out I removed the AC wire from the equation. That corrected the fuse issue, but we’re still getting the power fluctuations, so I’ll be tracking those down by checking grounds tomorrow, and then by running a new switched line from the battery if the ground search doesn’t prove fruitful. As Terec and I were putting things away in the garage and rolling the car back in I noticed some antifreeze that was pooled up on the steering rack bracket. At first I thought this was related to a loose plug that Terec had found earlier in the night, so we soaked up the pool and hoped that would be all we had to think of that. I got under the car though and started looking around with a paper towel, I swear I thought I found a place where more coolant was collecting, which isn’t a good sign. So we gave it all a good wiping down to try and dry it off, I’ll look at it again tomorrow and see if there’s more coolant, and if so try to track down that leak. So as of right now, in order to get this car running I need to:a) figure out the wiring issueb) figure out the fuel leak in the railc) see if the coolant is still leaking and then fix the leak. Of those items right now, C scares me the most, I’m hoping I don’t have to replace a head gasket or anything of the like. I’ll have video up from tonight, both my usual format, and some HD video as well. "

    "body": "2007/07/24 - Today was a good day! Progress was made! First things first, at lunch myself, Henry, and Eric headed down to High Ridge to SCPRacingparts. com again to get a cap for my Fuel cell, I realized yesterday that I was only using 3 of the 4 fitting points for the fuel cell, and I had better get something to cover the fourth one up. After work my Henry (one of my bosses) and his mechanic buddy Ronnie came over to the house, after we made a quick pitstop at Gateway Electronics again to get more wiring items (I also spotted the Rally Bug builders on their way home from work). Ronnie runs a shop down south near where he and Henry both live, so he was an EXCELLENT resource to have working on the car tonight. He and Henry got nearly every wire in the engine bay connected and placed in the appropriate areas, leaving just a few things for me to do in the bay. Eric also came over after making a trip to Autozone to get the battery for his 3rd gen RX-7 recharged. He finished up the fuel cell items that needed done. Adding the inline filter before the pump and then attached the vent line with the bulkhead fitting and check valve. I spent the evening doing minor things, mainly being in awe of all the work that Henry and Ronnie were getting done. I did track down some keys to the car, though I swear the keys I grabbed were the keys to the parts car I got rid of, one of them fit into the ignition for the 240z. I also figured out that the ignition has been turned on this whole time, which would explain why we never needed a key to turn the steering wheel when rolling the car around, though I’m not sure how it was turned on and the key removed. I do have the ignition out of the 78, as well as the turn signal and headlight switches from that car to try and use on the 73. Ronnie was able to get the power from the new battery hooked up to the starter, and alternator, which in turn got power to quite a bit of the car. One of the hazards work, the parking lights looked to work as when the headlights were turned on the rear lights lit up. I’ll have to figure out how to wire up the headlights in the future, but I’m guessing the wiring for them should be somewhat intact based on testing tonight. So I’ve got more work to do tomorrow night. I’ll try to finish up the wiring that is left in the engine bay, as well as wire up the fuse panel and try to mount the Megasquirt tomorrow night. Right now my goal is to try and start the car either Wednesday, or Thursday night! Though, I’m seriously thinking I won’t be going to Topeka, though I’m still hoping to at least take the car to the local autox this Sunday. "

    "body": "2007/07/23 - Here’s a quick update on the 240. I got up this morning and finished up modifications to the bracket I built for the VR sensor, you can see what it ended up looking like in the photo below. It’s not all that pretty, but not too bad considering I made it out of a drill press, vertical sander, and a jig saw.  I then ran out and spent a few more hours shopping. I went to AutoZone and purchased lots of random bits that I needed, another fuel filter (that didn’t fit), wires, splices, antifreeze, radiator hose, oil, gear lube, and a ton of other random stuff. I also took the battery I had purchased for the parts car back to get tested, it wouldn’t charge so they gave me a credit (it was out of the year’s free replacement), so I got a new battery for $9. 95. Whittle came over and assisted with a few more wiring questions. From there I tried to get started on wiring. I began by looking where exactly I was going to run the wires, in order to find an existing hole to run them through I got up under the dash and started removing things on the passenger side. The first thing I removed ended up being part of the AC system, which I wasn’t actually sure the car had! That opened up two holes, with grommets to boot, that allowed me to start running wires. Terec came over and started assisting with a few things, first thing we did when he got there was make a list of all the tasks left to do on the car. We used a sharpie on the windshield. After that, he was visibly more productive today than I was. He actually mounted the sensor up to the motor and made sure that it was within specs to the 36-1 wheel. After that, he was able to get the radiator mounted and the hoses attached to the proper locations. He then got the Oil Cooler mounted and the hoses finished up from what Eric started doing yesterday. You can see the oil cooler and radiator mounted in this photo.  I was able to get some of the EDIS wiring started, as well as power wires ran for both injector banks, as well as the Megasquirt harness wired into the engine bay, though the MS harness doesn’t actually connect to anything yet. I have a LOT more wiring to do this week, hopefully getting most of it done Monday and Tuesday night with a goal of trying to start the car on Wednesday. We’ll see if that happens, if I don’t at least attempt to start it before Sunday I’ve vowed to shave my head…. Here are more photos from today.

Once the intake/exhaust and turbo was all back together we went ahead and began the task of putting the motor back in the car. I’ve got some High Definition video of that process here on this Video Page. With Eric and Russ’ help we also managed to get the drive shaft connected up and the transmission into the cross member under the tunnel. Tonight I’m going to pick up more bolts, so we can mount the fuel cell bracket to the floor of the car and then we can hookup all the fuel lines. We’ll also be installing the fuel rail and injectors tonight so we can hook up the fuel lined up front. At that point I hope to start trying to figure out the wiring for the car, that’s the big project left for this weekend, get wiring going so we can try to start this bad boy up.

    "body": "2007/07/19 - Tonight Natalie and I went and looked at a house, it’s got ~5 acres, a 2 stall barn, a hay shed, and an oversized two car garage. That covers the basics. While looking around in the garage I found a circuit breaker, sweet, setup just for the garage. It’s even got a section marked “Welder”! score, 220 already wired in the garage. Where do I sign? I got home and finished dinner around 9 or 9:30pm, didn’t feel much like working on the car. So, I didn’t. Then I thought, well I had better check if the fittings I ordered last night would work on the oil cooler adapter. Guess what? They don’t f’ng fit! I don’t know who was smoking crack on the HybridZ Forums, but the oil cooler adapter plate’s fittings are NOT 18mm, at least the 18mm x 1. 5 to 10AN fittings I got sure are too damn big. After I found that, all the stuff I had overnighted from Summit last night is pretty much useless, at least until I figure out what sizes I really need, or I just try to order another oil cooler adapter. That set me over the edge, I decided I was just going to try and take the oil filter adapter out of the block from my 78 280Z motor sitting on the floor of the garage. The other night I attempted to find two nuts to fit over this to aid in backing this adapter out, I failed at finding any. So I took my vice grips and clamped down, the adapter came out rather easily. I stuck that adapter into the block on the turbo motor, and stuck the oil filter on. Problem solved, no more oil cooler, at least not for now. Though I could have saved myself a few hundred bucks had I just done that two nights ago :( Later tonight I went back out to the garage (around 11:30) and started looking at how I’m going to fabricate my mount for the VR sensor to read the 36-1 wheel. I think I have a good setup figured out and will fabricate that immediately after work tomorrow so I can try to finish up any welding I may need to do (I think that’s the last thing) because I know the Rally Bug will be needing the welder back soon!

    "body": "2007/07/18 - Monday night I didn’t get crap done on the project! I started to work on the oil filter/block attachment only to realize after driving around for 2 hours that I wasn’t going to find any easy way to block off the oil cooler attachments for the 83 L28ET motor. By the time I got home from that, it was well after 9, and I needed to spend some time with my wife. Tuesday I ordered AN fittings to go from the metric 18mm x 1. 5 oil cooler fittings to AN -10 fittings so that I can run steel braided lines to the new oil cooler I ordered. All of that should be here tomorrow. Tuesday after work I began putting things back together on the Intake Manifold. I spent far too long digging around the garage trying to find parts I haven’t seen in a few weeks. Yes, I need FAR BETTER organization in the garage. I’ll probably have to spend some time Thursday or Friday night cleaning up if I’m going to have anyone over to help out this weekend. After that, I headed off to Speed Sports up in Bridgeton (Speed Sports, store hours from 7-10pm M-F) to pick up some AN-4 steel braided line for my turbo oil feed. I got a 1/8” NPT to AN-4 fitting, a 90-degree hose fitting, and the fittings I needed on the turbo side, as well as 5 feet (about 1 ft too much) of AN -4 hose. I figured out when I got home that the port on the block for the oil fitting is NOT 1/8” NPT, it’s actually 1/8” BSPT, which is very similar, but different enough to make my fitting not work. With this info, I think I’ve now figured out why the pipe thread plugs I had purchased a few months ago wouldn’t work, I probably need BSPT for those as well. I’ve found a few parts online that I can order to convert from BSPT to NPT, I’ll see if anyone locally has those tomorrow, otherwise, I’ll get those ordered tomorrow. After leaving Speed Sports, I headed down the street to Autozone. At AZ I picked up a lot of hoses, clamps, and other random bits of things I needed to reassemble the motor. I also picked up a GM open element Air Temperature sensor to thread into the Intake manifold to be able to tell what the air temp is going into the motor, I had to get the Wells part, I think SU107 was the # but I could be wrong. AZ didn’t have a pigtail so I’ll try Carquest tomorrow to see if they have the pigtail so I can wire this up to the Megasquirt. When I got home I threaded the temperature sensor into the Intake manifold. I also managed to get the thermostat gasket installed into the housing, the GM Water Temperature Sensor installed into the Thermo housing, and cleaned up the snail for the turbo. It was a bit dirty from sitting in a barn for who knows how many years. I’ll take pics of everything later this week. After running around this evening I got to thinking about how much this project has cost me lately. Without going into specifics (because my mother will read this) I’ve spent more this month than I spent to purchase the car. June was the same, and possibly double what I’ve spent so far this month. I know I’ve got a few more things I’ll have to purchase, but hopefully, I’ve got all the big items out of the way, at least for this phase of the project. More coming this week, and I promise to start doing video again! "

    "body": "2007/07/16 - After yesterday’s fun, Eric and I spent some time in the garage today. I was awoken this morning around 8:00am by the doorbell; the Dish Network guy showed up right on time. More on that topic tomorrow on The Mad Blogger. After I got the Dish guy going, I sent Eric an SMS to let him know I was out in the garage working. The first thing I needed to do was lay some fiberglass in the passenger floorboard. I had missed a few spots on that side earlier in the week and laid some extra resin in the floor to smooth out the pockmarks from the cleaned-up rust. While I let that dry, I pulled the extra rear end that I had in the garage so I could start cleaning it up. As soon as I saw the rear end/suspension sitting in the driveway, I immediately noticed a difference from the rear suspension that is on the car currently. The current suspension doesn’t have a rear sway bar, the spare does. That’s fine and dandy, I’d prefer the rear sway bar, the problem though is that the fuel cell frame that I fabricated fits right where the sway bar goes on this spare suspension. I’m not sure what I’ll do with that aspect, but Eric and I spent the rest of the morning taking apart the spare rear suspension. We cleaned a lot of parts, figured out that the shocks (at least on the rear) are KYB’s, they do look to be fairly new (or unused as that may be more correct). We got just about everything apart and came up with plenty of parts to clean and paint (Powdercoat for Rande?) later in the project. Before I can use the rear sway bar, I’m going to have to figure out what I’ll need to change on the fuel cell bracket to make it work. I might be able to move the mounts for the bar a little higher to allow me to use the cell as currently fabricated. From there, Eric and I started to prep for painting the interior. We cleaned up some of the dust that had gathered, drilled some pilot holes for the seat bolts in the floor (to get to the rear brackets for the seat mounts we had to cut a hole for a socket to fit through). We brushed, vacuumed, wiped, and scrubbed the interior to try to get it ready for paint. We lowered the car down off the jackstands and spent the rest of the afternoon painting the interior with a nice satin black “Chassis Saver” paint that I had picked up on Saturday morning. I had purchased a gravity-fed spray gun back in 2003 when I had the 350Z, previously using it once to spray some waste of money wax on the car, the gun hadn’t been used since then. I think the paint this time around turned out great, an easy low-cost solution that is WAY cleaner than it was prior to all this work. It was a bit laborious, but I think well worth the effort, Eric agrees. Here are some before pictures: And here are some after shots: There are more photos in my Flickr set for Project240z. com We ended up painting a few coats over most areas of the interior and then let the car sit for a while to dry. Once dry, we rolled the car back into the garage and started running fuel lines. We ran both the feed and return lines for the fuel cell, mounted the pump again after removing it for paint, and fixed the fuel lines to the transmission tunnel. Tomorrow, I’ll be working on the motor again. I hope to get the intake and exhaust manifolds back on the motor so that we can put it in the car Tuesday or Wednesday night. From there, it’ll be time to start wiring up the Megasquirt. "

I used quite a few pieces of fiberglass matt on the passenger floorboard covering some of the holes. I also covered up a few of the sharper metal pieces of the floorboard.  On the driver’s side, I used minimal fiberglass matting and mainly used resin. The driver’s side was in far better shape than the passenger side so I used resin to smooth out the surface on the driver’s side. It turned out far better than I could have imagined! You can’t really see it in the photos, but it’s quite a clean look on the driver’s side now. I can’t wait to see how all this looks once painted. Though before I paint I’ll be cleaning up the fiberglass with some sandpaper.  I’ll spend some time Thursday and Friday night working on the floor. I hope to try to paint the interior this weekend. The interior may have to wait though as I hope to finish up a few other things this weekend, mainly the fuel lines and getting the motor back into the car. "

Thursday I got most of the driver’s seat mounts welded into place, but I didn’t finish them off, I left the tabs for the actualy mounts off. Friday night I tested some rust remover on the exhaust manifold, no luck on removing any rust with the products I tried. This morning I got up at 9:30am, lounged around for an hour and a half. I went out to the garage and welded in the tabs for the driver’s side seat mount. From there I was all over the place, here’s a list of things I worked on today, in no particular orderTest fitted new injectors in fuel rail/intake manifold  Cleaned the intake manifold Cleaned the exhaust manifold Test fitted IAT sensor in intake manifold Cleaned the transmission and bell housing Scraped undercoating off the car around the transmission tunnel and floorboards Removed all the stock fuel lines (3) Mounted the fuel pump and bracket Test ran some new braided fuel line (need to buy more as I don’t think 20ft is enough Prepped the driver’s side interior for paint (removed paint/primer, will do passenger side and paint later this week)I’ve gotta try to hit the junk yard tomorrow, also will be racing Jansoon’s M3, so we’ll see how my first BMW experience goes.

    "title": "Fuel Cell frame construction",
    "body": "2007/07/02 - This morning I set out into the garage to tackle a fairly large task, at least in my mind. My goal was to build a frame that will secure my 15 gallon fuel cell to the Project 240Z. In case you don’t want to read the rest of this post, I was successful! I began with a few shots of the car before I started cutting into it (further than I cut last weekend). There are various shots here, above and below.      After taking those shots I got to cutting. Dave (from www. soloperformance. com) and I had discussed how to mount the cell into the car on Tuesday when he came over, so I had an idea of what I wanted to do. I quickly marked some lines to cut with a sharpie, then proceeded to tear up two cutting wheels removing metal from the rear of the car. I don’t know why that stock metal tears up wheels, but they sure to go away quickly when cutting on the car. Here are photos of what was left after cutting.   The intention for the fuel cell frame was to bolt a bar on the back of the rear differential mount, weld to 1x1” square tubes parallel to the ground running towards the back of the car, then come up at a 90 degree angle from those tubes with more square steel. Those two vertical posts would weld to a bar running inside the back of the car, this bar would also be bolted into the car, not welded, so that if necessary the whole frame can be pulled out with minimal effort. Here are a few pictures of the end result of the frame, as well as some of my crappy welds! I figured out with all but two welds done, that I had somehow adjusted the wirespeed on the welder in the wrong direction, and that was why I was having a horrible time. I think they’‘ll hold though, they just aren’t very pretty!    This frame easily goes in and out of the car, which should come in handy if I ever need to remove the rear end (which I plan to when overhauling the suspension, after the car runs). Here are a few shots of the frame sitting in the car  And here is the end result, the fuel cell sitting in the frame, sitting in the car.  I think the frame turned out great and I love this photo The tank sits just low enough, it is barely visible from the back of the car, I actually had to walk 10 feet back and down a couple feet of driveway incline to see either the tank or the frame itself.  I’ve yet to bolt the frame to the car, but that can wait. I’ll get some nuts, bolts, and washers tomorrow for the various things I need to mount, fuel cell, seats, etc. All in all I’m really impressed with myself, I got a lot more done this weekend than most weekends, though I still have the build the driver’s side seat mounts, I finished the passenger side yesterday. What’s next? Well like I said, tomorrow night I’ll be building the driver’s side seat mount, as well as visiting Mr. Whittle’s house to test fit some fuel injectors into my new fuel rail that should be arriving and the old intake manifold. If the injectors he has fit I’ll be ordering injectors on Tuesday. After that I’ll be running fuel lines, and be working on putting the motor back together so I can attempt to put it back in the car next weekend if all goes well. That might be a lofty goal, but this whole project has been lofty for me, so why quit shooting high now! "

    "body": "2007/06/30 - Well, after figuring out that the seat mounts I had made earlier in the week wouldn’t fit I went back out to work on the 240Z this morning with a bitter taste in my mouth. I started off with a few quick pictures of what I had put together the other day.  From there I removed the Corbeau brackets and started grinding the welds down on the tabs that I had added to the cross braces. I removed all four tabs with little trouble. Being that I haven’t welded much before, this was the first time I’d had to remove a weld, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Here is the end result after removing the tabs.  From there I got smart, I decided to do a bit more test fitting of the seat before I did any more welding. I attached the Corbeau bracket back to the seat and put it in the car, using towels to keep the seat clean.  For the new positioning I decided the seat brackets basically needed to come forward in the car 4 to 5 inches from the original tabs I had made. With the two cross braces in place I wasn’t comfortable making tabs that long and with little support, so I installed two more cross braces into the car, in front of the two existing braces. These two new braces were each welded at the body, and then to the original (from earlier this week) brace in the middle, actually reusing the tabs I had recently removed to add some support in the middle. I then welded on new tabs, this time spanning both braces on each half of the seat, adding support to the tab, as well as making the tab 2” wide instead of 1. 5” as I had originally made. This should create for better support of the seat brackets. Here are the photos of the newly created tabs and cross braces.    I position and drilled holes for the Corbeau bracket in the new tabs, visible in the latter photos above. After getting all of this setup I was anxious to get the seat in the car and see how she fit. To get the seat in the car I had to mount the Corbeau bracket directly to the seat with 4 bolts that will go through the new tabs in place. I wrapped the seat in towels and put on some clean latex gloves so that I wouldn’t get the fabric dirty from all my gunk. In order to actually thread the nuts on the rear bolts I have to tilt the seat backward, for now this is alright, but when I actually go to use the seat this won’t work well. What I think I’ll do is get a combination of some rubber and metal washers, which I think will allow me to tighten the rear nuts down and still be able to tilt the base of the seat back a bit, once tight, lower the front of the seat into it’s tabs and tighten up the bolts there. The front tabs are easy to access, the rear tabs, not so much. Anyways, here are the photos of the seat in the car.   Tomorrow I’ll be installing the driver’s seat, most likely in the same manner as the passenger side, I’ll also be starting on mounting the fuel cell, cutting out sections of the rear floorpan, and then fabricating a frame for the cell to sit in. The ultimate goal for this 15 Gallon cell is to build a frame that will allow me to easily remove the fuel cell and install a smaller cell. Using the larger cell for Time Trial and HPDE events, and having a 5 gallon cell to use for autocross events, saving weight in the rear of the car. More tomorrow! "

    "body": "2007/06/29 - So tonight didn’t go to well. First off, I marked the tabs on the seat mounts for drilling, drilled the holes, (all too close to the edges IMHO) only to figure out that I had marked the holes with the corbeau bracket turned sideway, so they were all off by 90 degrees. Easy enough, redrill 3 of the holes, one was even worse off than before, too close to an edge, but I figured wtf I might as well tighten them all down and mount the seat right? See some progress. Wrong. The seat won’t fit. Long story short, be sure to measure everything before you go off and mount a seat! I’ll be cutting off the tabs and welding on new tabs tomorrow/saturday. The new ones will point forward, bringing the seat forward on the new mounts, rather than backwards, this should create the room I need. Currently it’s impossible to get the rear two bolts into the seat on the bracket, partially because I can’t actually slide the seat back all the way because it hits the wheel well for the rear. I am glad I chose to do the passenger side first, this way I should have the process down pat for when I go to build the driver’s side mounts this weekend. No pics, too pissed off tonight. "

More on tonight in a bit. Summit Racing kindly sent me all of the fuel part oddities I had ordered last week. I had a 12x12 box sitting at the office when I returned from lunch today. I was dissapointed to find such a small box, after spending so much money! But I guess I did order “small” parts. After work I headed home and met up with Dave from https://www. soloperformance. com/ who came over to lend a hand. First we hypothesized on how to mount the 15 Gallon fuel cell I have for the car. I think we’ve come up with a good plan, and I hope to start fabricating that later this week. After going over that plan we started cutting and fabricating new seat mounts for the Project240z. We got quite a bit done on the Passenger side of the car. I started on that side just incase I were to screw something up, I can always drive without a passenger seat if needed, but I’ll always need a driver’s seat! Here’s a link to the Video I took tonight. Towards the end you’ll notice a small camera issue, the tape came loose and the camera basically inverted, which made for some kinda cool video as well. I also took some pictures of what we accomplished on the seat mounts.    Tomorrow night, or Thursday I plan to finish up the passenger side brackets and get started on the driver’s side brackets, as well as to start cutting for the fuel cell. I’ll have to pick up some more 4. 5” cutting wheels though, I’ve gone through 3. 5 of them in the past two days of working on the car and have plenty more cutting left to do. I say tomorrow or Thursday, because I’m not sure I’ll get any work done tomorrow (Wednesday) because I may head off and play roller hockey with some guys I used to work with at The Sporting News, they are in the process of relocating the “online” side of TSN to North Carolina and I think Wednesday night is the last night for Ray Slover at the pickup hockey games that have been going on for the past 5-6 years now.

I got a replacement sander and brought it home to install. I setup the webcam on the wall, right above the work bench, and got to work assembling the sander. 5-10 minutes later I was ready to start sanding on the aluminum I had cut with a jig saw the day before to make a blockoff plate for my AAC valve on the intake manifold. I tell you what, a vertical sander is a fun thing to have! Here’s the result of what I was making, though I’m still going to drill a hole in it and tap that hole for the temperature sensor I’ll be mounting in the intake manifold.  I also got to use my new drill press to drill the holes in the plate, it all worked really darn well. After getting the plate made I decided it was time to remove the intake manifold from the car so I could tap and fill some of the holes on the manifold that I don’t need to use. I brough the webcam with me and mounted it directly above the motor on the chery picker. I started removing bolts, then decided to read the haynes, it told me I need to remove the Turbo and a few other things to get the manifold removed, I guess I should of planned things a bit better and done most of this work BEFORE I put the engine back in the car, it sure would be a lot easier to get to. Once I realized how much I had to remove to get the manifold off I decided I didn’t want to do all that last night, it was nearly 10pm by then. So I moved to the other side of the motor, bringing the camera with me to the other side. Andy and I decided last week to remove the attachments for the oil cooler for now, I’m going to attempt to get the car running without the cooler for now, and reinstall it down the road as I don’t have all the hardware for it. So I started removing it last night, got it removed, and then saw that without the attachment there isn’t a way to mount the oil filter to the block. So tonight I’ll be attempting to remove the oil filter attachment from the parts motor (78 l28e) to see if I can use it on the 83 L28ET. After all this I decided it was time to head inside and play with the cool video I had shot last night, only to realize that I had click on the record audio button, instead of record video. So yet again, there isn’t any video to be had :( Tonight though I promise I’ll do my best to get it right and have a video to post of the evenings work. "

I had planned on getting a lot done, but ended up sleeping all day. While it was nice, it was far from what I needed to get the car going. Tonight I went out with Russ and Matt Melton and Jeff “The Jeweler” Krekler, down to dinner in Soulard. From there I took Russ back to his house, saw his family, and came home with new motivation to get some work done on the car. I changed and went outside, setup the laptop to record video and go to work. I was cutting some aluminum scrap I picked up from the Metal Supermarket last Friday. I started making a new blockoff plate for the AAC valve on the L28ET intake manifold. I cut a rough pattern out with the jigsaw, made from tracing the bottom of the AAC valve with a sharpee and an awl to cut into the aluminum. I then went to assemble my new vertical belt sander that I purchased on Friday. The while taking it out of the box I noticed the darn thing was broken. Not likely broken to the point I couldn’t use it, but I decided nonetheless to box it back up and take it back to Sears tomorrow to get a replacement. So that was the end of work tonight, I couldn’t go any further on the plate and had some work to do on a few websites. I came inside to try to work on my video I recorded, but apparently managed to hose the video recording on the laptop by unplugging the camera before shutting off the software, so there’s a tip, if you’re using the lifecam software don’t unplug the camera before you shut down the software, you’re libel to lose your video.

It sure is purty, and big I’m not yet sure how I’m going to mount it in the car, though I’m hoping to talk to Mark Huebbe and borrow the welder again sometime soon so I can possibly make a bracket to mount it above the spare tire well in the car. That or perhaps I cut the well out and mount it, but that might be a future project. Whittle came over last night and we spent 3 hours going over the car and teaching me about relays and stuff about the Megasquirt. The squirt is nearly ready to install, he’s adding a jumper to the board for the MAF, but other than that I think it’s ready to go into the car as soon as I have all the wires run. I ran out tonight and picked up fuses, have yet to find a good fuse block though. I tried Autozone, they had something that might work but I had hoped to find something a little cleaner so I ran to Radio Shack and Walmart, neither place had any fuse blocks to use. I’ll try a few more places tomorrow and see what I can locate. I really only need like 6 fuses but I bought plenty of spares. I need to fabricate something to mount the fuse block and a couple of relays too. I’m thinking some sort of black plexiglass/lexan or acryllic of some sort, though I’m not sure where to even begin looking for something like that in town, so they might just get bolted down to a piece of sheet metal for the time being. So what’s next? Here are my goals for this weekend.  Get the fuel cell mounted and lines ran, I ordered a fuel pump from Jegs yesterday, should be tomorrow or Friday.  Remove the oil cooler attachments for now and screw on the filter in place of the adapter, I’ll run without one for a bit, once I plan on having the car driving for more than 15-30 minutes at a time (1-3 minutes for autocross) I’ll look at oil cooler options Mount the VR sensor for the Megasquirt Mount the radiator and get hoses that will work.  Get the other set of front rotors turned and put back on the car w/ new bearings. Pictures and video of this weekends work coming early next week! As for what’s after this weekend? Well getting all the wires for the Megasquirt run! Hopefully Nick can assist me with that next week over a few nights and we’ll see if I can’t get this darn car ready to run! Update: I found a source for Plexiglass and ordered a few square feet, some black and some smoked! "

I’d love to have it together by the Impala event here in St. Louis on the 17th of June so I can try to get some time running the car. Anyone up for some assistance? Here’s what I need help with. Installing the fuel cell/lines/pump. I need to come up with some sort of exhaust for the car, as Atlanta has noise requirements that need to be met.

A pair of latex gloves, a shop light, a paint scraper and my heat gun. I went to work on the interior of the car and got most of the remaining tar board out of the floorboard of the driver and passenger sides.

At least, hopefully a good enough seal the motor will run, after it runs the pipe will be tossed as it’ll get replaced with an intercooler.

    "body": "2007/05/15 - Last night I spent a few hours sitting in the car. I had decided over the weekend I needed to take out all of the interior, or at least most of it, and clean up the inside of the car. I can always get the outside painted later, but the inside, if I’m going to be in it, needs to be cleaned up, and painted. It’s orange, or red, I can’t tell which, and though most of the interior items cover the orange there are gaps that show through. So I took out all the diamond plate looking black vinyl, and then started removing the tar board and furry coating over the transmission tunnel. I’ve removed all that I think I can remove right now, and eventually will also pull the dash out and replace the dash with a fiberglass dash I acquired when I purchased the car. While sitting in the car I had a lot of time to think, and based on the state of the car (old, rusty, partially assembled) I have decided that I won’t be building the car up to SM2 rules anymore. I’ll be aiming for the new XP class in SCCA Solo. By going to XP, I no longer have to worry about a few major things that I was concerned with. I don’t have to deal with the interior anymore, I can do whatever I want (I think), so I can do something custom inside, without having to worry about SM2 rules about interiors. Moving to XP also frees up my options with mounting my seat. With SM2 mounting my seat like I plan to mount it may not have been legal, it’d have been a grey area, but within the rules of XP I believe I’ll have all sorts of options for mounting the seat and remaining in the rules. So, XP here I come. I still plan to compete in SM2 for St. Louis region autocrosses this year, at least 4 more in SM2, then I’ll try to run the 240Z in XP, unless of course I just talk myself into running XP for enough events to qualify for a year end class championship.

We got some aluminum to fabricate blockoff plates for the various items we’ll be removing from the motor, distributor, EGR valve, etc. We removed the Air Inlet Pipe, running from the Turbo to the Throttle Body as the grommet there looked to be torn. Removing it we found that to be the case, as well as that it appears to not be formed properly, possibly abused by a previous owner. I took the angle grinder to the car as well removing from rust from in front of the rear driver’s side wheel. I then, for the first time in my life, applied Bondo to try to cover some of the holes left behind by the rust. I’m going to sand it down tomorrow and try to spray it with primer to to keep some of the rust from forming again. Dad ran new fuel lines for most of the rubber lines. We also bought some hardware to fabricate the throttle controls as the linkage from the parts car and this car don’t quite match up together.

Not likely to get any work done tomorrow as I have a meeting tomorrow night, but Dad took the radiator from the 78 to get it cleaned up and pressure checked at a shop tomorrow sometime. At lunch I’ll also hopefully be getting the 37pin plug for the Megasquirt put together. "

    "body": "2007/03/28 - Dad and I spent a few hours working on the 240z this evening. We got the clutch pedal in, and even got as far as putting the Clutch Master Cylinder in the car. We went to put the 78 280Z brake booster in the 73 240Z, but ended up figuring out that the firewalls on the two cars are different, and the booster out of the 78 won’t fit in the 73 with a clutch installed. Sooooo, now we’re trying to verify that we can use the recently purchased rebuilt brake master cylinder for the 78 booster, on the 73 booster, without any issue. We’ll see how that goes! After work today I ran to Illinois again to hit the Speedway salvage yard up for more parts as well. I picked up 3 wiring harnesses for the fuel injectors for the L28 motors. 1 set was off my old parts car, another off a 78 coupe that was there and another set off an 82 I believe. I’m hoping with all those connectors I can come up with at least 6 that are good enough to use to start the car up. After the junkyard I hit up Carquest to pickup the rebuilt master cylinder, it was actually just about the same price as a rebuild kit, so buying the already built one made too much sense. Hopefully tomorrow we can get that rest of the brake and clutch items squared away. I’m also making an electronics run tomorrow to get bits and pieces of items necessary for the megasquirt install that I hope to tackle this weekend. "

Dad and I spent all day today working on the car, and I even swung by one of Jeef’s old employer’s to pickup some parts today as well. Dad spent most of the morning working on the clutch master cylinder and brake master cylinder, cleaning them up quite a bit, and using a rebuild kit on the clutch MC. The brake MC has some corrosion inside, so I’ll be ordering a rebuilt MC tomorrow that I should be able to pickup tomorrow night. I spent the morning taking parts off of the 78 motor, cleaning them and putting them onto the 83 motor. Over the afternoon and early evening Dad and I managed to seperate the 5spd transmission from the 78 motor and put it onto the 83 motor. From the looks of things the 83 motor was either once powering an automatic tranny, or was prepped to perform that work as we had to replace the driveplate with the flywheel/pressure plate from the 78 motor as well. After getting the transmission together and putting some of the parts I scavanged from the 78 motor Dad and I managed to get the motor into the Project 240z. I must say, removing motors is far easier than actually putting them back in the car. We put bolts into the motor mounts, and also into the crossmember underneath the transmission to hold it all in place, but have yet to tighten anything down just yet. The megasquirt equipment should be here soon, hopefully. I’ve still gotta find a few parts for the ignition/fuel system. My goal is still to fire up the car next weekend, though I’m going to need a lot of help to do that. I’m still hoping Mr. Whittle will be able to assist this week with getting the Megasquirt setup on the car. Does anyone have a Ford Cobra MAF lying around anywhere? I’m in need of one.

I didn’t realize you could spend that much on junk? I got most of the ignition system I needed to complete the Megasquirt setup, some interior plastics I needed, as well as the steering wheel off my parts car that I dropped off at Speedway two weeks ago. I think they even charged me for the wheel. Dad took apart the brake master cylinder and start cleaning it, we’ll do the same with the clutch cylinder tomorrow, and reassemble that with the rebuild kit I picked up this evening. I couldn’t find a brake mc kit in town tonight, so that will have to be a future product. I also picked up 7 feet of hydrolic line to run a new clutch line and repair a brake line I had to cut last week. Tomorrow (Today) we’ll see how far we can get towards putting the 83 motor into the car. I’m going to be working on getting the parts we need off of the motor from the parts car so we can get the motor setup to drop in the car. More tomorrow "

I had planned to remove the diff from the car this morning, along with the door lock from the passenger door, ignition switches and such as well. I got the switches and locks, but had a hell of a time trying to get the diff out. I got everything disconnected except the axles, without any luck getting the axles removed I gave up, hastily slapped some bolts/nuts back on the diff to hold it in place and I took some wire to tie up the driveshaft to keep it from hanging down to the floor. After clearing off the parts I knew I wanted I had to run down to SoloPerformance to drop off the Engine Hoist that I’ve had for, oh almost the past year. Dave needed it for a week or so, and all I’ve been doing with it is using it as a nice engine hanger lately. After that quick trip I grabbed Natalie, hopped in the Tahoe and headed up North. Went to the Elterman’s to pickup his trailer so I could haul cars to Egypt and back. From there we headed back home, loaded up the parts car and took off to Speedway (junk yard) in Illinois. They were pretty lax about things, which was nice, I rolled the car off the trailer and headed over to the super secret storage facility. From there we filled up the flat spare tire and rolled it out of the shop and onto the trailer for the trip back home. Both towing trips were uneventful, which was nice, though each car did shift around on the trailer a bit. The Tahoe towed fine, which is great! Though, I still want to see about getting a gooseneck trailer at somepoint to tow with the F350. On the way home from the super secret storage facility I decided to stop and double check the straps, just to make sure I wasn’t going to lose my baby. I stopped out in front of this great sign ;) After getting home, Natalie and I unloaded the 240 from the trailer, though, not before I took the time to sweap the 5lbs of rust that the parts car had deposited on the floor of the garage. After rolling her into the garage and test fitting a few of the interior pieces we headed back up north to drop James’ trailer off. They weren’t home, lucky for them. Had he been home he might have had a heart attack watching me back the trailer in, I ended up parking it about 6 inches from the front of the STi, that darn slopped trailer, makes it hard to judge distances. Lucky for me I stopped when I did, otherwise I would have felt like a complete ass for borrowing a trailer and then hitting the owners car when returning it.

I drove over to Hall Street, and found no one over there to take it. So I headed to Illinois and Speedway said they would take it. So next weekend it’s making a trip to Illinois for it’s final resting place. After that I headed to Sauget to do some inventory on the 240Z, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised! I had forgotten how much of the stock interior actually remained in the car. I was very happy to find that the headliner, center console, dash, and some of the tunnel interior still there, which makes my life a WHOLE lot easier to get it legal for SM2 in SCCA Autocross. So I only have to order a few things, rather than a complete interior which I was having trouble finding!More work tomorrow, I need to finish up the 280Z tomorrow as I’m going to be on the East Coast all of next week.
