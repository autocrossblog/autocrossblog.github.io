											So it has been a while since I’ve had the time to get a
											blog post up here, so let’s get started.
										</p>

										<iframe

										<p>
											After the last post, the car was almost ready for the
											Dixie National tour, held in Cecil Georgia, but there was
											some final prep to do. I took the car down to Solo
											Performance to corner weight and align the thing, with
											good results.
										</p>

										<p>
											<img

												alt="#350z #autocross #balance #weight # alignment"
											/>
										</p>

										<h3 id="alignment-specs">Alignment Specs:</h3>

										<table>
											<thead>
												<tr>
													<th>Total Weight (empty / driver)</th>
													<th>3099lbs</th>
													<th>3351lbs</th>
												</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
												<tr>
													<td>Front Camber (LF / RF)</td>
													<td>-3.5</td>

										</table>

										<p>
											Total empty weight was with all loose items removed (spare
											tire, tools, carpeting). Total weight with driver using
											additional weight to mimic driver.
										</p>

										<h3 id="st-louis-region-test--tune">
											St. Louis Region Test &amp; Tune
										</h3>

										<p>
											The corner weight/alignment was completed just in time for
											the St. Louis region’s impromptu Test &amp; Tune. The
											weather didn’t pan out well, cold and wet, but the region
											did a great job of throwing together a last minute T&amp;T
											at Gateway Motorsports Park on March 13th. Due to the
											weather, not much was done in terms of actually testing
											and tuning, I used the event as a driver shakedown to try
											to get the winter rust out of my head, I also used it as a
											trial test of towing the car behind the 2008 Tahoe.
										</p>

										<h3 id="dixie-national-tour">Dixie National Tour</h3>

										<p>
											For the Dixie National Tour, Natalie and I towed the car
											down to Georgia (<a href="https://izzyscustomcages.com/"
												>thanks to Izzy’s for the trailer</a
											>). We went down a couple of days early to spend a day
											with one of my bosses hiking through
											<a
												href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154059936489703&amp;set=a.230948829702.168653.685999702&amp;type=3&amp;permPage=1"
												>beautiful Amicalola Falls State Park</a
											>. After the hike and staying a night in the cabin, we
											headed down through Atlanta. I don’t know if I have ever
											had a good time driving through Atlanta, and this trip was
											probably the worst in terms of our experiences. Waze took
											us through downtown, getting off the highway, to try to
											avoid some of the accidents on the highway, but Waze
											obviously didn’t know we were pulling a car on a trailer,
											because the route was definitely not ideal for the rig.
										</p>

										<p>
											We ended up in Valdosta Georgia a day earlier then
											planned, which ended up making things much easier on us
											Friday when we got up, washed the car, and headed out to
											the event site, the South Georgia Motorsports Park. Friday
											morning we parked, unloaded the car and headed over to the
											practice course to try to get more of the rust off (the
											driver). Practice went pretty well, though it was crazy
											busy, so long waits between the practice runs. Brian
											(former car owner) ended up taking some runs as well as he
											was going to be co-driving with me for the Dixie Tour.
											After practice runs I made Natalie head out for a bicycle
											ride with me, it was our first time experiencing riding
											for your life while being chased by some very angry dogs.
											Other than the dogs, the ride was flat, fast and great
											exercise.
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											Saturday and Sunday for the Tour went well. Saturday
											morning started out wet, we ran first heat, but it was
											drying, so there was definitely an advantage to being
											second driver if you had two drivers, as the surface was
											getting dryer/faster every additional run. At the end of
											Saturday runs I was sitting in second place in the 7
											driver STU class. Brian was sitting in the 3rd and final
											trophy spot. Sunday we both drove well, all driver’s in
											the heat benefited from dry runs. Both of us ended up
											falling back, myself one position to finish third (final
											trophy spot) and Brian back two, to fifth for the weekend.
											I was pleased with the result, and happy to finally have
											fun in the car, I was beginning to worry I wasn’t going to
											enjoy autocrossing this 350z after the first two events I
											had done in it.
										</p>

											Post Dixie National Tour

										<p>
											From Dixie, the car was loaded up on the trailer and
											headed to Chattanooga (with Brian), while Natalie and I
											headed south to Orlando for a few days at a work
											convention. On the way back up to Chattanooga on Thursday
											morning to get the car, Brian sent me a txt telling me
											that someone had attempted to break into the car while it
											was sitting on the trailer at his shop. Somehow they were
											unsuccessful at getting in, but they did manage to bang up
											the driver’s door and window (about $1500-2,000 worth of
											damage).

										<p>
											The drive back through Atlanta was fun again, lots of
											accidents and idiots, along with the fact that I had the
											news about the car, it wasn’t a very fun day. We picked
											the car up and drove up to Tullahoma to stay the night,
											before heading to the Jack Daniel’s distillery on Friday
											morning.

											St. Louis Region Event #1
										</h3>

										<p>
											The first local SCCA autocross in St. Louis was held on
											Sunday April 3, 2016. Overall the event went okay, I won
											the STU class by a couple of seconds, but ended up in 7th
											on the overall index. Not exactly the position I was
											hoping for. The car drove well, I feel like I just didn’t
											drive it to the full extent of how it can be driven, and
											my position on Index showed that result.
										</p>

										<h3 id="local-event-2">Local Event #2</h3>

										<p>
											Event #2 of the St. Louis 2016 series was held this past
											Sunday at the Family Arena in St. Charles. Once again, I
											finished on top in the STU class, but this time in 8th
											overall on Index. Again, there was more in the car, though
											I don’t know if there was a full 1.2 seconds more, which
											is what I would have needed to move in front of the STF
											index winner.

										</p>

										<h3 id="trying-out-solostorm">Trying out SoloStorm</h3>

										<p>
											One thing I will be doing this year is trying to improve
											my driving. I find that overall my instincts are “pretty”
											good as to where I can go fast, and where I can’t, my gut
											gets me pretty far. But I honestly don’t think it gets me
											far enough. I have a hard time “improving” on autocross
											runs typically, meaning I’ll go out and put down a pretty
											quick time, but not improve much over the next 2 runs
											(more if local events), which means I am oftentimes not
											getting all that I should be out of the car, or myself. I
											am going to try to improve my driving through the use of
											technology, and the hot tool right now for that in
											Autocross is an Android app called
											<a
												href="https://www.petreldata.com/product/solostorm-gps-obd-ii-and-video-logger-for-android-v2-2/"
												>SoloStorm</a
											>, from
											<a href="https://www.petreldata.com/">petreldata.com</a>.
										</p>

										<p>
											With SoloStorm you can analyze the data from your runs
											quickly from an Android tablet inside of your car. In the
											past I’ve tried to look at data from the DL-1, on a
											laptop, between runs, but it was clunky and not easy
											enough to do that quickly. With SoloStorm you are able to
											look at runs, segments, and compare where you are faster
											or slower, this can be extremely useful when you have two
											drivers as you can compare your run to the other driver to
											see where you can each improve.
										</p>

										<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>

										<p>
											Next weekend (April 30, May 1st) I’ll be at the Grissom
											Classic in Peru Indiana, and the following weekend I’ll be
											at the Wilmington ProSolo. See you out at an event!
