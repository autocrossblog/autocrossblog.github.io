Welcome to the GitHub Repository for AutocrossBlog.com. Here you'll find the Jekyll code for the website. What use will it be to you? Probably not a whole lot, but if you're looking to get into using Jekyll you should definitely check out [JekyllExample.com](https://www.jekylexample.com). This website is based off the template available there.
