											This weekend I spent some quality time finally working on
											the 350z before the upcoming autocross season (Dixie Champ
											Tour is coming up quickly).
										</p>

										<p>
											In prep for STU, I want to see what kind of weight I can
											get out of the car. I really don’t know if this car (2003
											Touring) can come anywhere close to what my first one
											(2003 Enthusiast, 3075lbs) weighed, or even the second one
											(2004 enthusiast, 3062). I have yet to get it up on the
											scales, but I assume going into this that the car is
											heavier than both of them. The power, heated, leather
											seats that came with the car, along with the potential
											extra stereo equipment, and electronics for the VDC mean
											the car likely weighs a good bit heavier than the previous
											cars.

											A week or two ago, I headed out to Solo Performance to try
											on a few different seats. I wanted something that would
											drop weight and add some rigidity and support. SPS has
											quite the selection of seats, and had an

												href="https://www.soloperformance.com//NRG-Innovations-FRP-310-Racing-Bucket-Seat--Medium_p_11673.html"
												>NRG Innovations FRP-310</a

											weigh 250lbs (working on dropping that weight as well),
											and I actually fit semi-comfortably in this seat. I chose
											to go with the

												>NRG Innovations FRP-300</a
											>
											instead however, this seat is the Large version of the one
											that SPS had in the shop.
										</p>

										<p>
											We weighed the seats, along with a mount, on the SPS
											shipping scale and were shocked at what we found, the
											scale read what we thought was 9 pounds for the seat and 4
											pounds for the mount. Dave at SPS also ordered me a set of

											to mount the seats into the car. All the parts arrived
											early last week, so I headed over to the shop on Sunday to
											work on removing the old seats and putting in the new
											ones.

										<p>
											It is good to have a friend in the business, while I could
											have installed the seats in my own garage, having others
											around while working on the car and watching various other
											work get done on customer vehicles is motivating.
										</p>

										<p>
											Installation of the seats is fairly straightforward, but
											it did take me far longer than I expected. The main
											problem I ran into is that, at 6’4”, I needed to have the
											seats in the lowest position possible when mounting them
											(driver’s side all 4 corners on the lowest setting,
											passenger side 3 of the four, due to a hump in the
											passenger floorboard at the tunnel). Getting the seats
											onto the Buddy Club rails at the lowest position was easy
											to do when I didn’t tighten everything down and test
											fitted the installation, but as soon as I tried to tighten
											everything down I pretty much had to try it multiple times
											to get things lined up correctly so that the rails didn’t
											hit the bottom of the seats, and the holes in the rails
											lined up with the bolt holes in the floor.
										</p>

										<p>
											Even with all the test fitting I did, after getting them
											mounted in I find that the sliders are binding up.
											Fortunately, I can move the driver’s seat enough to make
											myself comfortable, but anyone shorter is going to have
											troubles, so hopefully, I can work out the binding issues
											down the road.
										</p>

										<h3 id="350z-seat-weight">350z Seat Weight</h3>
										<p>
											When I got the seats and rails mounted, I decided to weigh
											them, I was shocked at what I found, 11lbs. I then put the
											stock seats on the scale, and they weighed in at 19lbs.
											This was going to be a problem, in SCCA Autocross, STU
											class, you can replace the seats, but if you do, the
											replacement must weigh 25 lbs. What advantage would I have
											of replacing my 19lb seat with a 25lb seat? Is the “grip”
											worth the extra 6 pounds? The more I thought about it, the
											more something had to be wrong with the scale. There’s no
											way the stock seats only weighed 19 lbs. So off to grab a
											25lb plate Dave had around the shop for help in corner
											weighting and alignment. I threw that on the scale, and
											boom, 11lbs. Wait, what? A quick check of the scale’s
											display and we realized that the scale was in kilograms.
										</p>

										<p>
											So how much did they weigh? Well, the stock seats weighed
											in passenger 43.5lbs and driver 44.85 lbs, the NRG
											FRP-310s with Buddy Club rails, weighed in at 24.45lbs
											(passenger) and 25lbs (driver).
										</p>

													<td>OEM Touring Leather</td>
													<td>45lbs</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>NRG FRP-310 w/ Buddy Club Brackets</td>
													<td>25lbs</td>
												</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>

										<p>
											To get the passenger seat legal, I stuck 1/2 pound of lead
											wheel weights on the bottom of the seat. After reviewing
											the pictures I took, I saw that when I weighed the
											Passenger Side seat, I didn’t have the slider arm on it,
											that might have made up for my weight difference.
										</p>

										<p>
											How do they fit? Well, they fit the driver great, while
											they aren’t all that comfortable for ingress/egress of the
											vehicle, when sitting in them they are amazing, I don’t
											plan to do long road trips in them (hello trailer, soon) I
											think I could drive to/from Kansas City for an autocross
											in relative comfort.
										</p>

										<h3 id="door-panels">Door Panels</h3>
										<p>
											The ONLY problem with the seats, the large (didn’t test
											the medium size) is a little too wide up top for the stock
											door panels on the 350z. The doors press against them when
											they close, and due to the styrofoam body of the panels,
											they now have indentations in them from the doors pressing
											against the seats. I figured I have two options, 1) shave
											the seats down, removing the cover to file them or 2)
											leave them as is and not care about the door panels. I’m
											going with option 2 for now, the car has a specific
											purpose, and that is to autocross, if I ever get annoyed
											by the indentations/damage to the panels perhaps I can
											find panels to replace them.
										</p>

												alt="NRG FRP-310 Seat installed in 350z"
											/>
											The one thing I didn’t test, is how the seats will do with
											a helmet on. I have a feeling I will likely rub a little
											bit on the top, but if necessary, I can always pull the
											padding from the bottom of the seat (and be sure to add
											weight) to drop down an inch or two in the seat while
											autocrossing. With times for autocross being fairly short,
											sitting without padding for those periods shouldn’t be a
											huge deal.
