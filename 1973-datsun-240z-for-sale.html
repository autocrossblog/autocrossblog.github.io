				"articleBody": "THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD, NO LONGER AVAILABLE\n\nSo I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around. Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to sell it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I wait to see if it sells, and then who knows what will happen after that. At this point in time I’m not looking to part the car out, that might change in the future, but for now I’ll keep from parting it out.\n\n\n\nBasics:\n\n  Price: $1750 with all the spare parts (storage bins full), $1250 with the car as it currently sits. (add $250 to clean up title)\n  Year: 1973\n  Make: Datsun\n  Model: 240z\n  Title: None (can be acquired at additional cost)\n  Mileage: Unknown\n  Location: Parker, Colorado (delivery available at $1.25/mile up to 500 miles from Parker, CO)\n  Thoughts: Depending on the needs, I can get the title cleared up on this car. I have a California title from a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it titled in my name. It is going to cost me a couple hundred dollars to get the title in my name due to fees, if the purchaser needs a title we can have this done.\n\n\nEngine:\n\n  L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2\n  Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo\n  Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo\n  Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all there.\n  Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently dumps under the driver\n  Thoughts: The motor runs, though it is a tad picky to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of the manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment, knowledge I just don’t have.\n\n\nTransmission:\n\n  5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings on transmission mount.\n  Thoughts: Transmission works great as far as I know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and also drove fine with the previous motor in this car.\n\n\nFuel System:\n\n  Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell\n  Pump: High Pressure Pump (from Jegs)\n  Lines: Stainless steel primarily 8AN\n  Rail: Custom aluminum rail from Lonewolf Performance\n  Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr\n  Pressure Regulator\n  Thoughts: No known issues with the fuel system, everything works as it should.\n\n\nECU:\n\n  Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune)\n  MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3.0 PCB\n  MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods\n  MSStim22-C\n  LG-Wirebund\n  LC-1 without gauge\n  Thoughts: As far as I know everything works great with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I don’t know enough to properly tune everything.\n\n\nSuspension:\n\n  Stock 1973 240Z\n  Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/ front/rear sway bars (spares not included for $1250)\n  I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far have only put bushings into the steering coupler and the transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250 price)\n  Thoughts: The suspension is something I intended to address after having the car together, painted, and running.\n\n\nWheels/Tires:\n\n  Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires\n  Thoughts: Nothing special here\n\n\nInterior:\n\n  Seats: None\n  Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not included at $1250)\n  Carpet: None\n  Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except for the dash area which was removed after paint.\n  Thoughts: The interior needs some love depending on your intentions. I had planned to put a cage in, but haven’t had it done. I had some Corbeau A4 seats in the car, on custom welded in mounts, but the seats were too tall. Putting in other seats may require some fabrication work. My intention was to put in a race seat.\n\n\nBody:\n\n  Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2\n  Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73 240z\n  Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and painted.\n  Thoughts: Passenger floor pan had some rust, cut out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere, but I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The body definitely needs some love and a paint job to get the car cleaned up. The passenger door needs some adjustment, it doesn’t close easily but will shut and stay closed.\n\n\nPictures and Video:\n\n  I posted a lot of pictures of the car that I took yesterday, you can see them on this Flickr Set. If you would like to see other photos of specific parts please let me know.\n  I also took a video of the car running yesterday, you can see it starts off rough, but once going doesn’t sound half bad. Video of the 240z Running\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:    \nI am torn on selling the car, as you can see in the intro to this post. I’ve had it for three and a half years now, and I would love to have the time to finish it, but to be honest I haven’t had time over the past 3.5 years, I don’t foresee having the time/motivation to do it anytime soon. I’m not going to part the car out, and if it doesn’t sell, perhaps i will find the time to do more on the car. I spent a few hours cleaning things up yesterday and renewed my motivation to want to work on the car, but still not enough to decide not to sell it.\n\nIf you are interested looking at the car please use the contact form here on Project240z.com, the car is only available on the weekends to be looked at right now.\n\nThe two domain names, www.project240z.com and www.240z.net are not included in this sale, but may be available if someone is interested in those.\n",

										<p>
											So I really am looking to sell the 240z this time around.
											Though, the more time I spend on it, the less I want to
											sell it, so perhaps I’ll continue working on it while I
											wait to see if it sells, and then who knows what will
											happen after that. At this point in time I’m not looking
											to part the car out, that might change in the future, but
											for now I’ll keep from parting it out.

											/>
										</p>

										<p><strong>Basics:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>Price:</strong> $1750 with all the spare parts
												(storage bins full), $1250 with the car as it currently
												sits. (add $250 to clean up title)
											</li>
											<li><strong>Year:</strong> 1973</li>
											<li><strong>Make:</strong> Datsun</li>
											<li><strong>Model:</strong> 240z</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Title:</strong> None (can be acquired at
												additional cost)
											</li>
											<li><strong>Mileage:</strong> Unknown</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Location:</strong> Parker, Colorado (delivery
												available at $1.25/mile up to 500 miles from Parker, CO)
											</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> Depending on the needs, I can get the
												title cleared up on this car. I have a California title
												from a previous owner, I’ve signed it, but never got it
												titled in my name. It is going to cost me a couple
												hundred dollars to get the title in my name due to fees,
												if the purchaser needs a title we can have this done.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Engine:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>L28E from a 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2</li>
											<li>Intake/Exhaust Manifolds from a 1983 280ZX Turbo</li>
											<li>Turbo from a 1983 280ZX Turbo</li>
											<li>
												Oil cooler not currently installed, bypassed, parts all
												there.
											</li>
											<li>
												Exhaust, straight pipe coming off the turbo, currently
												dumps under the driver
											</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> The motor runs, though it is a tad
												picky to start. I’m pretty sure it’s a combination of
												the manifolds and megasquirt needing some adjustment,
												knowledge I just don’t have.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Transmission:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												5 Speed from 1977 Datsun 280z 2+2, new urethane bushings
												on transmission mount.
											</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> Transmission works great as far as I
												know, worked in the parts car that I got it out of, and
												also drove fine with the previous motor in this car.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Fuel System:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Tank: 15 Gallon Fuel Cell</li>
											<li>
												Pump: High Pressure Pump (<a
													href="https://www.jegs.com/i/MSD/121/2225/10002/-1"
													>from Jegs</a
												>)
											</li>
											<li>Lines: Stainless steel primarily 8AN</li>
											<li>
												Rail: Custom aluminum rail from Lonewolf Performance
											</li>
											<li>Injectors: Ford Racing 42lb/hr</li>
											<li>Pressure Regulator</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> No known issues with the fuel system,
												everything works as it should.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>ECU:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Megasquirt (purchased/assembled from DIYAutoTune)</li>
											<li>MS130-C Assembled Megasquirt-I with V3.0 PCB</li>
											<li>MOD_130-EDIS: EDIS mods</li>
											<li>MSStim22-C</li>
											<li>LG-Wirebund</li>
											<li>LC-1 without gauge</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> As far as I know everything works
												great with the Megasquirt, the only issues are that I
												don’t know enough to properly tune everything.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Suspension:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Stock 1973 240Z</li>
											<li>
												Spare suspension parts also off a 1973 240z, w/
												front/rear sway bars (spares not included for $1250)
											</li>
											<li>
												I have a urethane bushing kit for the car, but so far
												have only put bushings into the steering coupler and the
												transmission cross member. (kit not included at $1250
												price)
											</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> The suspension is something I
												intended to address after having the car together,
												painted, and running.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Wheels/Tires:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Stock steel wheels, R-Compound Hoosier Tires</li>
											<li><em>Thoughts:</em> Nothing special here</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Interior:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Seats: None</li>
											<li>
												Dash: Removed, fiberglass dash available (dash not
												included at $1250)
											</li>
											<li>Carpet: None</li>
											<li>
												Paint: Interior painted in a black undercoating, except
												for the dash area which was removed after paint.
											</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> The interior needs some love
												depending on your intentions. I had planned to put a
												cage in, but haven’t had it done. I had some Corbeau A4
												seats in the car, on custom welded in mounts, but the
												seats were too tall. Putting in other seats may require
												some fabrication work. My intention was to put in a race
												seat.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Hood and headlight buckets from a 1977 280Z 2+2</li>
											<li>
												Doors and rear hatch (w/ spoiler) from a different 73
												240z
											</li>
											<li>
												Air Dam, not sure of make, needs paint scraped off and
												painted.
											</li>
											<li>
												<em>Thoughts:</em> Passenger floor pan had some rust,
												cut out and welded in new metal. Floor then covered in
												fiberglass. The rust doesn’t appear too bad elsewhere,
												but I’ve not stripped the car looking for things. The
												body definitely needs some love and a paint job to get
												the car cleaned up. The passenger door needs some
												adjustment, it doesn’t close easily but will shut and
												stay closed.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Pictures and Video:</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												I posted a lot of pictures of the car that I took
												yesterday, you can see them on
												<a
													href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/sets/72157623124463062/"
													>this Flickr Set</a
												>. If you would like to see other photos of specific
												parts please let me know.
											</li>
											<li>
												I also took a video of the car running yesterday, you
												can see it starts off rough, but once going doesn’t
												sound half bad.

											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											<strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> <br />
											I am torn on selling the car, as you can see in the intro
											to this post. I’ve had it for three and a half years now,
											and I would love to have the time to finish it, but to be
											honest I haven’t had time over the past 3.5 years, I don’t
											foresee having the time/motivation to do it anytime soon.
											I’m not going to part the car out, and if it doesn’t sell,
											perhaps i will find the time to do more on the car. I
											spent a few hours cleaning things up yesterday and renewed
											my motivation to want to work on the car, but still not
											enough to decide not to sell it.
