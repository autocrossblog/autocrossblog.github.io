        <title>Project350z 20 Years Ago Today</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;20 Years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 20 years since I picked up the 350z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know where it is, I wish I still owned it. Maybe one day Dozzle will let me buy it back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are photos from the day I purchased the car. Actually, this was the day I picked up the car, I went back the next day to sign the papers. I had a date (first date) and the paperwork was taking too long, so Todd (at Bommarito Nissan) told me to come back the next day rather than miss the date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last photo is of the 99 Z-28 that I traded in that day for the 350Z.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why you should autocross</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Autocross is an exciting and challenging motorsport that is quickly gaining popularity among car enthusiasts. It is a competitive event where drivers navigate a course that is laid out on a large parking lot or closed-off airfield. The objective is to complete the course in the fastest time possible, while navigating tight turns, hairpin bends, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.specfrs.com/autocross-accident-why-you-need-autocross-insurance&quot;&gt;other obstacles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about autocross is that it is accessible to a wide range of drivers. Whether you are a seasoned pro or a beginner, there is a class for you. This means that you can compete against drivers of similar skill levels, which makes for a fair and enjoyable competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about autocross is that it is relatively inexpensive. All you need is a car, some safety gear, and a desire to have fun. You do not need a high-powered or expensive racecar to participate. Many people use their daily drivers, which keeps the cost of entry low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things you need to participate in autocross is a good set of tires. Tires are the only point of contact between your car and the ground, and they play a crucial role in your car’s performance. Good tires will provide better traction, which will help you navigate the course faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to buy your autocross supplies, including tires. They have a wide range of tires that are specifically designed for autocross, so you can be sure that you are getting the best possible product. They also offer a variety of other autocross supplies such as suspension upgrades, brakes, and other performance parts that can help you to improve your car’s performance on the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing high-quality autocross supplies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt; also offers great customer service. They have a team of knowledgeable and experienced staff who can help you to find the right products for your car and your driving style. They also offer installation services, so you can have your new parts installed quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a fun and exciting motorsport that is accessible to a wide range of drivers, then autocross is definitely worth considering. It is a great way to push yourself and your car to the limit, and it is also a great way to meet new people and make friends.

        <title>Where to buy a race helmet in St. Louis?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a racing helmet in St. Louis Missouri, you should be looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com/&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPS has a large number of different helmet makes models and sizes that you can try on in their retail store. Here’s a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://soloperformance.com/pages/find-us-service-info&quot;&gt;visit their St Louis location&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-i-need-to-try-on-my-helmet&quot;&gt;Do I need to try on my helmet?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying on your helmet is important, you want to make sure what you select fits you properly, and is comfortable. You’ll be wearing it for a long time, so you want to make sure it’s comfortable. You also shouldn’t just buy the cheapest helmet you can find, but what you can afford. We’re talking about protecting your noggin, I assume that is important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-brand-helmet-do-i-need&quot;&gt;What brand helmet do I need?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand specifics will obviously vary, do you need/want the most expensive coolest looking helmet? Or do you need the one that does the job the best? My recommendation is you try on multiple brands and see which one feels best, and meets your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;can-i-buy-a-helmet-online&quot;&gt;Can I buy a helmet online?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely you can buy a helmet online. &lt;a href=&quot;https://soloperformance.com/collections/helmets-and-accessories&quot;&gt;SoloPerformance.com&lt;/a&gt; has one of the largest selections of helmets online, they sell hundreds of helmets a year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Year Later</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I realized a couple of days ago that it had been 12 months since the FR-S met its unfortunate demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only autocrossed once since then, in Dave’s Mustang at the 2021 Solo Nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s going to change though. I’ve got the bug. I need to find a ride. I need a project car, I need a toy. Sometime later this year the FR-S will be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FR-S ended up going north, I think towards Minneapolis. The guy who purchased it owns a body shop, I was told it would end up being a track car, but I haven’t seen any progress pictures on it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Parting out the Scion FR-S</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The time has finally come, time that I finally have, to try to start getting the 2016 Scion FR-S parted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got the car unburried from the smaller side of the garage and pulled it into the bigger 2 car bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, I got the car up on jackstands, after finding the wheel lock, and took the Konig wheels off the car. David Z picked those up from me yesterday afternoon, so the wheel and tires from the car are gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up I will be taking the SSC suspension bits, and the nameless exhaust, and replace them with the OEM parts. Once I have those off, hopefully in the next week, I’ll be selling those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;need to get to the DMV and get the lean cleared off the title so I can easily part with the car/title.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decide how much of what was removed will be put back on the car (front/rear bumper, lights, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in any of the car, or SSC bits, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car is located in Wildwood Missouri, just outside of St. Louis. The motor has less than 45k miles on it and runs great.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Autocross Crash and Why You Need Autocross Insurance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there, long time no see…. Where has SpecFRS gone? Well here’s the story of how my autocross car came to a very sad demise, and a couple of tips for you on how to not have it happen to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost: Look into Autocross insurance. Lockton Motorsports provides insurance options that cover cars DURING autocross events, you should definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://locktonmotorsports.com/autocross-off-track/&quot;&gt;check them out&lt;/a&gt;. It is very likely that your normal street car insurance policy will NOT cover you, and you asking them if they do may even cause red flags to be raised. I did NOT have autocross insurance on my 2016 Scion FR-S, even though I had looked into it a couple of weeks before the incident, I didn’t pull the trigger (if memory serves, it was like $225 for the year for my car), and would have likely made 2021 not be near as bad as it ended up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-will-not-autocross-a-car-again-if-it-doesnt-have-autocross-insurance-i-dont-care-who-owns-the-car-lesson-hard-learned&quot;&gt;I will not autocross a car again if it doesn’t have autocross insurance, I don’t care who owns the car, lesson (hard) learned.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened? Well, this incident occurred this summer. I had taken my third run and put down a scorcher, my codriver went out and took his third or fourth run (don’t recall). I was standing next to a buddy of mine trying to watch the run when I saw the car get tail happy, due to where I was standing in grid I couldn’t really see the car/course very well. The car came to a stop and I thought, “oh he just lost control and stopped”. Shortly there after I heard a request for any first responders over the PA, I immediately knew something was wrong. I ran over to where the car was stopped, as I was on my way over I saw a course worker picking something up, I assumed it was a GoPro that had fallen off the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a GoPro, it was the passenger mirror, or parts of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to the car, my codriver was either out, or getting out of the car. He wasn’t happy, but didn’t appear to be hurt, that was the immediate question to be answered, make sure he was okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we started looking at the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car had impacted a light pole in the parking lot, scraping down the passenger side of the FR-S. The damage started at the front fender and went all the way back to the quarter panel. The majority of the damage was the passenger door, it was pushed in quit a bit, and didn’t look like it would open. The car would start and drive, so I got in and drove it outside of the course area. The wheel was definitely out of alignment, and had a LOT more play than it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-800-158409714.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-400-158409714.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-600-158409714.jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-800-158409714.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/6-13-2021/side-1000-158409714.jpg 1000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side curtain and passenger seat airbags deployed. There was glass everywhere, while the window was down, in the door, it had enough of an impact that the glass from the door and in the mirror, went everywhere. Getting into the car you had to be careful to avoid setting your hand down on something and getting yourself cut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After parking the car I started trying to assess the situation. We threw a jack under it and removed the right front wheel. The wheel had some damage to it, after removal I found that the tie rod bolt was bent about 45 degrees. At this point I figured there was no way to safely drive the car home, so I began to figure out how to get it home. I called my insurance to get roadside assistance to pick it up, but ultimately a friend was driving through town with an empty trailer and he hauled the car down to Solo Peformance Specialties for me that evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that week I replaced the tie rod end, that helped bring the wheel back into some version of alignment, but not 100%. I ended up driving the car home to my house from Solo Performance a week or two later and parked it in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the car to two different locations for an estimate, ultimely we choose to go with a facility that friends had had good experiences with. They took the car and ordered a few thousand dollars in parts to try to get it ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They ended up digging into the car, cutting the fender and quarter panel off, removed the door, and gave me an updated estimate (we asked them to do that, dig in and let me know if it was going to be more costly than originally expected). Based on the updated estimate, we determined that it just didn’t make sense to repair the car to street car condition. I picked up the car and brought it home in November and it’s been sitting in the garage since, collecting dust. Currently the front and rear bumpers are off the car, along with the lights on the passenger side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring, hopefully sooner rather than later, I will be stripping the SSC parts off the car and seeing if anyone wants to purchase those. I will also be selling the wheels which have Falken 660 tires on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I will put the OEM suspension back on the car and see how much I can get for it. I really think it would be a good car to start a track/road racer build out of, but I simply don’t have the time or motivation to complete a project like that myself. The motor has ~42k miles on it and was very strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything but the passenger side of the car was prestine, so who knows what I can actually get for the car. I won’t be parting it out individually at this point, unless I find some car that I think I can easily throw the motor into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a track project car, feel free to reach out to me, let’s see if we can make a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s next for me? Well right now I have an order in for a new Nissan Z, and a Ford F-250 truck. I have no idea when either of those will be built….&lt;/p&gt;
