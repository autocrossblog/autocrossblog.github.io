        <title>What happened to Solo2.org?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-beginning&quot;&gt;The beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, there was Christoc.com’s Racing Forums, that was quickly replaced with Pylon.CC, and ultimately became SOLO2.ORG. CRF started out with a little guerilla marketing, I would take photos at autocrosses (film) and then print out all the photos, at the next event I would distribute those photos to the various cars in each photo and include a printed out small flyer promoting the Forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pylon.CC was a cool iteration with a decent logo, but back in the day the North American Pylon (magazine) folks got upset that I was using “PYLON” in the branding. That ultimately didn’t cause me to change the name, but I believe one day in February some year I stumbled on solo2.org and picked up that domain name, ultimately migrating all the forums/content over to the new domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-middle&quot;&gt;The middle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its heyday, solo2.org was one of the premiere autocross websites, with traffic from all over the country regularly posting. It was dominated by the St. Louis autocrossers, but definitely attracted users from other locations as well. It was featured in many magazine articles throughout the years, from Grassroots Motorsports up to the likes of RACER and Motortrend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were T-Shirts, lunch boxes, and even g-string thongs with SOLO2.ORG logos. And stickers, you can still find a SOLO2.ORG sticker on a variety of autocross cars around the country. I’ve got a couple hundred of those stickers still in a box here, if you want one let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end&quot;&gt;The end&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately with the rise of Facebook and groups there, along with a few other forums getting more rowdy national level autocross discussions solo2.org slowly withered away. A couple of attempts were made at reviving the site, but nothing ever really stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the domain redirects here to AutocrossBlog.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never say never though, SOLO2.ORG might come back one day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Solo National Championships Writeup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A month late, it’s time to blog about the 2024 Tire Rack SCCA Solo National Championships…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link href=&quot;/assets/css/lightbox.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;/assets/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did this post take so long? Well immediately after Nationals I got home and continued to work on photos from my RainbowMarks Photography business. It was a good week in Lincoln, I took something like 28k photos and posted a large number of those online for the world to see (and buy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to presell enough photo packages to make the work required to take photos of every individual competing at Nationals (barring those in 5th heats when I was working or running myself) worth it. Overall the photography experience was fun, but a crap ton of work. I likely won’t shoot every car/competitor possible again, but never say never. More on what photos for the 2024 Solo Nationals sometime next summer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s talk about the 2024 Solo Nationals experience, outside of the photo side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparation-for-the-2024-solo-nationals&quot;&gt;Preparation for the 2024 Solo Nationals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prep for this year’s Nationals consisted of me heading to Houston for work a couple of days before I was heading to Lincoln, so mostly Thursday night and Friday I madly scrambled to get everything packed up. The beauty of co-driving with someone like Dave is that you don’t have to bring much with you, he’s got the car/trailer and all the supplies, so really most of my packing was related to camera/photography needs, along with the usual autocross supplies of clothing, sunscreen, helmet and racing shoes. I filled the back of the F250 with tubs full of stuff, as usual, and managed to not use most of it, also as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;travelling-to-lincoln&quot;&gt;Travelling to Lincoln&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday morning I hit the road towards Lincoln. I had intended to go the northern route from St. Louis, skipping I-70 in favor of MO-36, basically heading north to Hannibal and then west. The problem was I just went through the motions and turned west on I-70 without thinking about it and made my way towards Kansas City the usual way. The trip was uneventful, no incidents of traffic outside of some construction west of KC, but Waze had me jump off the highway to avoid most of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Lincoln Friday afternoon and was able to get situated with Dave and Beth at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com&quot;&gt;Solo Performance&lt;/a&gt; trailer for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturdays-cam-invitational&quot;&gt;Saturday’s CAM Invitational&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday over on what was partially the pracitce course for the week was the CAM Invitational, an event put together for the CAM and XA/XB Classes to allow for a year end culmination of CAM events. Dave, Beth and I took part in the invitational and shootout. During the invitational portion of the event I performed pretty poorly, finishing 8th in CAMS outside of the trophies with cones on a number of my runs. Dave finished 2nd for that portion of the event. The shootout went a bit better, but I’ll be honest, I can’t exactly remember where I ended up and the results online don’t show anything actually useful in terms of who finished where, but I’m pretty sure I beat Dave, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;museum-of-speed&quot;&gt;Museum of Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening the CAM Competitors were invited to the Museum of Speed from Speedway Motors, which if you’ve never visited is a must see in Lincoln Nebraska. It had been years (12?) since I had stepped through the doors there, I was glad that I did this year and spent some time walking around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos I took on my phone at the Museum after the dinner and awards ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuesday-and-wednesday-competition-at-the-solo-nationals&quot;&gt;Tuesday and Wednesday competition at the Solo Nationals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAM-C ran on Tuesday/Wednesday of the week of Nationals, late in the day. So we had plenty of time to get course walks in. I actually didn’t walk as much this year as I have in the past, I managed 3 walks of our first course on Monday I believe, along with 2 walks early Tuesday morning. Tuesday evening I walked day 2’s course twice and then repeated that again Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall with the results I was pleased, I got my 3rd National trophy with a 6th place finish in CAM-C, but I was sitting in 5th after Day 1. Day 2 I managed to only get a clean run on the first run, so I wasn’t able to defend that 5th place spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave ended up in 4th for the event, 2 trophies ahead of me. Here are some videos of our 2024 Solo Nationals runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thursday-and-friday&quot;&gt;Thursday and Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running on Tuesday and Wednesday frees us up for Thursday and Friday. I was announcing the 5th heat on Thursday/Friday for my work assignment, so I shot photos most of the day then got myself ready for the runs I was covering. I ended up announcing for FSAEL, GS, STH and a couple of other classes I’m forgetting :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too eventful happened, but it was great to get to call Evan William’s G Street win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s coming next? Well, the next weekend after Nationals I ran a local event in an AS Z06, that was fun! I am leaning towards running in SSC again in 2025 though, so I will be working on purchasing a new ride for that endeavor hopefully in the next month or two!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 Things to Prepare for at the 2024 Solo National Championships</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you’re heading to your first Solo National Championships, it can be overwhelming, you’ve likely never experienced anything like you’re going to see this week in Lincoln Nebraska, so I’m going to try to take some time to give you a heads up! Hopefully it will help you have an even more fun week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-one-of-the-largest-motorsport-events-in-the-world&quot;&gt;1. One of the Largest Motorsport Events in the World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Solo Nationals is one of the largest motorsport events globally, featuring nearly 1,300 competitors over four days. When you combine this with the ProSolo Finale and CAM Challenge beforehand, there will be nearly 7,000 competition runs. It’s a massive event that brings together the best autocross drivers from across the nation, making it an experience like no other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-course-walks-are-important&quot;&gt;2. Course Walks Are Important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Nationals, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to walk the courses. You’ll run two separate courses: the East and West, sometimes referred to as the “plane” and “corn” sides. The courses will be open for walking multiple times throughout the week, starting on Monday when no competition runs are happening. They are open all day Monday from around 10 am and then each morning from Tuesday to Friday before competition starts. Walking the course multiple times helps you familiarize yourself with the layout, visualize your driving lines, and plan your strategy for each run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-social-activities&quot;&gt;3. Social Activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of opportunities for social activities throughout the week of Nationals. Local regions often host cookouts, parties, and other gatherings around the paddock, creating a festive atmosphere. You’ll find everything from big wheel races to margarita machines and beer trades scattered throughout the area. Whether you prefer to stay on-site for the festivities or explore Lincoln’s local scene, there’s no shortage of ways to unwind and connect with fellow competitors and enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-getting-around-town-in-lincoln&quot;&gt;4. Getting Around Town in Lincoln&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln, Nebraska, the host city for the Solo Nationals, is a vibrant college town with a variety of restaurants, bars, and local attractions to explore. The city is easy to navigate, with most amenities and popular spots located within a short drive from the event site. However, keep in mind that the Solo Nationals coincide with the University of Nebraska’s football season, and there are games on the weekends that bookend the championship. This can lead to increased traffic and limited parking, especially downtown and near the stadium, so plan your trips accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-length-of-the-courses&quot;&gt;5. Length of the Courses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you will likely experience for the first time at Nationals is the length of the courses. These courses are typically over a minute long, which is quite different from the shorter courses most people encounter at local autocross events around the country. The extended length of the courses can be both exciting and challenging, providing more opportunities for mistakes but also allowing drivers to showcase their endurance and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-much-better-competition&quot;&gt;6. Much Better Competition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition at Solo Nationals is often top-notch, bringing together the best drivers from all across the country in every class. This is where you’ll find the elite competitors who excel in their local regions, making the challenge at Nationals significantly tougher. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t come out on top. Nationals is as much about learning and growing as a driver as it is about winning. Use this opportunity to gain experience, connect with fellow competitors, and make new friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-tire-service-and-other-vendors&quot;&gt;7. Tire Service and Other Vendors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re coming to Nationals and need tire services such as mounting, balancing, or flipping, be sure to check out SPS and RS Racing, located near the front of the paddock. They provide excellent on-site services to help drivers with their tire needs throughout the event. In addition to tire services, there are several other vendors on site, including food vendors, coffee stands, and booths selling t-shirts and event merchandise. Be sure to visit them multiple times throughout the week to see what they are offering. Supporting them is a great way to contribute to the community and keep the event lively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-paddock&quot;&gt;8. Paddock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paddock at Solo Nationals is enormous, and it’s likely unlike any event you’ve attended before in terms of size and the number of competition and support vehicles packed into one spot. The area is meticulously organized into laid-out rows and columns, so it’s important to pay attention to where you are assigned to park. Make sure not to encroach on someone else’s space, as every spot is accounted for. The paddock tends to get extremely crowded on Tuesday and Wednesday when competitors for Thursday and Friday arrive while those who competed earlier in the week may still be there. Be patient, be kind, and help people out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-results-and-announcements&quot;&gt;9. Results and Announcements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay connected and informed throughout the event by using the Sportity app, which is an essential tool for the Solo Nationals. This app provides a wealth of useful information, including run time updates, important announcements, and links to results. It’s the best way to stay up to date with what’s happening on and off the course. By regularly checking the app, you’ll ensure that you’re aware of any schedule changes, heat updates, or other critical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-results-and-awards&quot;&gt;10. Results and Awards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, results and awards at Solo Nationals were traditionally handed out at banquets on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday nights. However, the format has changed, and now trophies are awarded directly in the grid after the competition ends for the day. It’s important to pay attention to when and where the awards are being given out. Even if you don’t end up taking home a trophy, it’s a great experience to stick around and cheer on your fellow competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-more-things-to-know-for-your-first-solo-nationals&quot;&gt;5 More Things to Know for Your First Solo Nationals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Weather Preparedness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The weather in Lincoln can be quite variable in early September. Be prepared for anything from hot, sunny days to sudden thunderstorms. It will also be WINDY. Make sure to bring appropriate clothing, sunscreen, hats, and rain gear to keep yourself comfortable in all conditions. It’s also a good idea to keep an eye on the weather forecast and be ready to adjust your plans if needed. Staying prepared will help you focus on your runs and enjoy the event, no matter what the weather brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Car Preparation and Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nationals is a rigorous event for both drivers and their cars. Before you head to Lincoln, ensure your vehicle is in top condition. Bring along spare parts, tools, and fluids to handle any unexpected repairs or maintenance needs. Doing regular checks between runs can prevent minor issues from turning into major problems, keeping you competitive and on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Navigating Event Schedules and Heat Assignments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With so many competitors and multiple heats, staying on top of your schedule and heat assignments is crucial. Knowing when you need to be at the grid and when you have downtime will help you plan your day effectively. Make sure you’re aware of any schedule changes and be prepared to adjust accordingly to stay on track for your runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Community and Networking Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Beyond the competition, Solo Nationals is a fantastic place to network with other drivers, meet people from different regions, and build lasting friendships. Take the time to introduce yourself to others, share experiences, and learn from more seasoned competitors. The community at Nationals is welcoming, and you’ll find plenty of opportunities to connect with like-minded enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Local Attractions and Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lincoln and its surrounding areas offer a variety of attractions and activities. If you have some downtime, consider exploring local parks, museums, or other points of interest. This can make your Nationals experience even more memorable and give you a taste of what Lincoln has to offer beyond the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending the 2024 Solo Nationals as a first-timer will be an unforgettable experience filled with learning, competition, and new friendships. Embrace the excitement, enjoy the challenge, and most importantly, have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and see you on the course!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re heading to the 2024 Solo National Championships in Lincoln Nebraska starting late next week you should check this out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is run by Chris Hammond, a 24+ year autocrosser who really got into photography due to the sport of autocross. He’s been attending the Solo National Championships off and on since 2000 and has taken photos at pretty much every one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year he’ll be there again competing, in the Solo Performance Specialties Mustang in CAM-C, but he’ll also be shooting photos all week (including the ProFinale). You can pre-purchase a vehicle photo back for $125 ($175 including the pro) which will get you all the high resolution digital downloads of the photos he captures of your car and publishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This special is ONLY available before competition starts on 9/3/2024, after that you can purchase individual photos for $25/download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no limit to the number of drivers or classes per car, so you can walk away with a heck of a deal at this $125 price.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 Grissom National Tour</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are what, less than 4 weeks from the 2024 Solo National Championships? I decided I better get back to an event and get some practice in. And boy am I glad I did, I sucked, I need to get some more reps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Autocross/Grissom-National-Tour&quot;&gt;View Photos from the Weekend!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend was the Grissom National Tour, held just outside of Grissom Air Reserve Base in Bunker Hill, Indiana, where I lived and went to high school for my sophemore year back in the day. I headed up from St. Louis on Friday morning, taking a few work calls along the way and while I was on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got there just in time to take a couple of practice runs. The practice course was a good example of what the Saturday course would be. No offense to the course designer, but that course sucked. Such tight turn arounds that left you with very little variation and no flow what so ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up sitting in 4th on Saturday after the first day of runs, way off the pace of the leaders in CAM-C, including Dave the car owner. I was pretty miserable at the experience. The only bright side of Saturday, okay there were two bright sides: I got to announce for the first time in quite some time, that felt good and I got complements on the effort from a variety of folks. The other bright side was the weather, couldn’t have asked for a better weekend of weather in Mid-August!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are both Dave and my best runs from Saturday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chris-hammond-run-3-53922-1&quot;&gt;Chris Hammond Run 3 53.922 +1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dave-whitworth-run-3-53278&quot;&gt;Dave Whitworth Run 3 53.278&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WOd7Plz-gk?si=n20_T3qsIxqeDEEH&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was a little better, though Dave wasn’t as close to the leader in CAM-C as he was on Saturday, I was happy to be closer to Dave and further up on the Index for the day (somwhere around 35 vs 76 the day before, 51 with both days combined). The course was actually ran in the same direction as Saturday, with a few of the turns modified to not be quite so restrictive, knocking off 5-6 seconds off the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Dave’s best run from Sunday, GoPro Hero12 mounted on the front of the hood of the Mustang:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dave-whitworth-run-3-47585&quot;&gt;Dave Whitworth Run 3 47.585&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up in third for the weekend in the CAM-C class, Dave ended up in second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to Nationals in Lincoln Nebraska in 3 weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2024 SPS Pick The Winners Contest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a link in our main navigation to AutocrossRank.com, that’s our sister site! Another project from Chris Hammond!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got big visions for the project, but for now we’ve launched it with a reincarnation of the Pick The Winners contest that we used to run over on SCCAForums.com. This year’s contest is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocrossrank.com/pick-the-winners/2024-solo-nationals&quot;&gt;2024 SPS Pick The Winners Contest&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com/&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt; for stepping up and providing a price for the contest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-pick-the-winners-contest&quot;&gt;What is the Pick The Winners Contest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest is pretty simple, see who can pick the most correct winners of classes at the 2024 Tire Rack SCCA Solo National Championships in September. The goal is to have more winners chosen than anyone else who votes. There is a tiebreaker defined in the rules which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocrossrank.com/pick-the-winners/2024-solo-nationals&quot;&gt;check out on the page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pick-the-winners-contest-history&quot;&gt;Pick The Winners Contest History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was originally started by Josh Sirota long ago, I took it over from him when I was helping run SCCAForums.com for Dave Schotz. As we retired that website in favor of most conversation happening on Facebook groups these days the contest kind of fell by the way side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-win&quot;&gt;How to win?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you research, pick who you think will actually win each class at Nationals. Be sure to update your votes right before the deadline, the Monday before Nationals starts on Tuesday, so that you get access to any last minute class changes!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1975 Triumph TR6 Alternator Upgrade and Replacement</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So now for a little story about the Triumph. The first of potentially many. Another Project car!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-triumph&quot;&gt;What Triumph?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Triumph you might ask? My Dad purchased this car in 1985 when he was stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina. He owned the car up until he passed away in September of 2023. My brother and I have both decided that the car won’t leave the family, so I’ve got it at home in my garage for now, at some point he will likely take it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/tr6-800-a107e35f4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1975 Triumph TR6 at the LeCave Trailhead in Wildwood Missouri, loaded with hockey equipment&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/tr6-200-a107e35f4.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/tr6-400-a107e35f4.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/tr6-800-a107e35f4.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/tr6-1277-a107e35f4.jpg 1277w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s get into some details. The Triumph has been in decent shape for its whole life, Dad used to spend hours working on it, seeing him do that got me doing the same on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.projectvw.com&quot;&gt;1973 Super Beetle&lt;/a&gt; back in the day. The last time I drove it, either late last year, or early this year, I was taking it from the house to my parent’s storage unit, wanting to get it out of our garage for the winter so that we could get some of our own vehicles in the garage, and at the time I also still had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autocrossblog.com/2008-corvette-for-sale&quot;&gt;the Corvette in the garage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my way to the storage facility (one evening, so it was dark or getting dark), it started to act funny, run funny, kicking and choking. I managed to pull into a grocery store parking lot trying to determine what was going on, and ultimately pulled through that lot into a parking lot for the local Library. At that point it died and I couldn’t get it started. I called up a buddy who happened to live within a 1/4 mile of the library and he came over to help tow me to the storage lot, just another mile or so from the library. Before we tried towing it though we threw a little battery jump box that he had onto the car, that allowed me to start the car up and drive it the rest of the way to the storage lot, but as I pulled in to enter the keycode to open the gate, the car died again, draining the jump box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pushed it down to the storage room and put it away for the winter. I figured either the battery died, or the alternator died, so I would need to check those out and replace one or both come spring time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-to-get-the-triumph-home&quot;&gt;Time to get the Triumph home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by getting back over to the storage unit and grabbing the battery out of the car. Took it home, charged it. Then took it to Autozone to have it tested. Battery tested okay. So that left me with the idea that the alternator must be shot. One afternoon I called my buddy who helped me get the car back to storage, he shuttled me to the storage unit and then followed me home as I drove it back home on the fully charged battery. No issues getting home running on just the battery, but it was done during the day so the headlights weren’t on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the car home I decided it was time to order an alternator, first looking at Moss Motor’s website to see what they had in terms of an Alternator for a 1975 Triumph TR6. They had a rebuilt unit, available for cars with an air pump, for $450, quite pricey (I didn’t realize at the time that included the refundable $200 core charge). I thought there might be a better option so I searched around, initially at local autoparts stores and online, but I simply couldn’t find an alternator that would work. After searching for a bit I started stumbling on some threads in old british car forums suggesting that you could swap out a 75 alternator with one off of a 78-80 Ford Fiesta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Existing Lucas alternator in the 1975 Triumph TR6&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-2-800-5c0fa1aca.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Existing Lucas alternator in the 1975 Triumph TR6&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-2-200-5c0fa1aca.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-2-400-5c0fa1aca.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-2-800-5c0fa1aca.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-2-1500-5c0fa1aca.jpg 1500w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From reading, it appeared that it should simply be a drop in replacement without modification to wiring, so I figured I would go that route, a benefit of the change would be improved amperage of the Fiesta alternator as well. I ordered a unit from RockAuto, part number 13107N. Upon receipt I realized it wouldn’t quite be as drop in friendly as I had hoped. When I tried to mount it to the side of the engine I realized that the holes wouldn’t align to allow me to mount it and use the tensioner that was used on the previous Lucas alternator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Old and New alternator sitting on the garage floor&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-3-800-3f6df102d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old and New alternator sitting on the garage floor&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-3-200-3f6df102d.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-3-400-3f6df102d.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-3-800-3f6df102d.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-3-1500-3f6df102d.jpg 1500w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-help-for-the-triumph-alternator&quot;&gt;Getting Help for the Triumph Alternator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching out to Dave at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com/&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt; for some advice (he’s my go to for all advice) I learned that you can “clock” an alternator, which basically involves taking the shell apart and rotating it to get the right location for mounting into the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clocking an alternator seemed pretty straightforward, undo three sets of nuts and bolts, remove the cover, rotate the cover (120 degrees so that the flange lines up) to the right position, and then put it back together. And it went just as simple as that. I had it apart and back together in under 15 minutes, but as I was done and getting up from where I had been working on the alternator I came across a small piece of what looked like a magnet on the floor. I thought “oh damn, I broke something”. So I took the alternator back part and started looking for broken bits inside to see if I broke something. After looking it over, it sure looked like things were in their appropriate location, so I put the alternator back together and got to putting it back into the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-6-800-6a2a17164.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Random thing found on the ground after clocking alternator&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-6-200-6a2a17164.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-6-400-6a2a17164.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-6-800-6a2a17164.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-6-1500-6a2a17164.jpg 1500w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon putting the alternator back in the car I figured out my next problem. With clocking it, the hole in the flange where the bolt would go through was no longer big enough for the previously used mounting bolt. That was an easy fix though, I grabbed a 5/16” drill bit and a hand drill and opened it up a bit to make everything fit. From there it was a matter of plugging in the wires, putting the belt on the pulley and starting up the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ignition-bulb-powers-alternator&quot;&gt;Ignition bulb powers alternator?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh I forgot to mention, while I was looking around for info about clocking the alternator I came across some forum threads that talked about an Ignition light/lamp on the dash of the TR6 that should light up when you turn the key on, and go out when the car is running and the alternator has engaged and is charging. I also read that if the bulb in that lamp goes out, the alternator won’t charge the battery. What? Yeah, you read that right. If the ignition light bulb on a Triumph TR6 is burnt out, the alternator will not work and charge the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this led me down the path of trying to see if that bulb worked. When I turned the key on, it didn’t appear to light up, so I reached up into the dash to see if I could access it, it easily came out of the back of the dash. Basically the whole socket pulled out, easily removable from within the gauge cluster. I pulled the bulb out and took it with me to a parts store. I tried Napa, the guy there figured out the part number, but unfortunately didn’t have a replacement bulb in stock, part number 1449. I drove 30 minutes to a Carquest whose inventory showed in stock online, only to be told they couldn’t find them. A quick search on Amazon and order placed would get me a new bulb the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunady morning I waited around for the delivery of the bulbs from Amazon, upon receipt I put it into the sock and turn the key on, no dice, the bulb won’t turn on. I look at the box and realize I actually ordered bulb 1446, not 1449. Another Amazon order placed and a few days later I had the proper 1449 bulbs in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, put the bulb in the socket, turn the key, and nothing. WTF. Long story short, apparently the bulb isn’t grounded, and won’t light up just hanging below the dash. I eventually put it back into the gauge cluster and turned the key, and what do you know, the ignition light came on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on to starting the car and seeing if the alternator worked. Nope…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulb would turn on, the car would start, but the bulb would never go out. As I understand it, the way the alternator works is it needs a 12v signal to “start” up, while the belts running and it receives that signal, once it is up and charging, it grounds that signal and the ignition light goes out. (I’m not an electrician, if any of that is wrong, apologies) No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get the bulb to go out, and I couldn’t get the battery to charge from the alternator. I started testing out the voltage at the battery, on the back of the alternator, elsewhere, and nothing showed me any juice coming form the alternator more than the battery voltage, this told me that the alternator wasn’t sending power to the battery and thus wasn’t charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-alternators-tested&quot;&gt;Getting the Alternators tested&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up taking the original Lucas alternator (FYI, I don’t think it’s the original 1975 alternator, but likely one my father had put in at some point), to Autozone to get tested. The guy running the testing bench struggled quite a bit and never couldn’t quite get the machine working 100%, but at one point it did flash a “failed” message on the screen before quickly going off to some other screen that said it needed something else done. A couple of days later I brought the “New” alternator in as well, to see what it would test at. As I walked in the guy behind the counter (a different guy) asked “Didn’t you just bring that in the other day to test?”, to which I replied yes and no. This was a different alternator. He ended up getting it setup on the bench and testing it out. Sure enough, it also failed. On the autozone testing bench it was not showing as good, and thus not producing power. At this point he basically promised me he could get me an alternator, so I said go for it, I checked and your website said you couldn’t. A few minutes later he was defeated and I was on my way home, needing another alternator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ordering-a-second-alternator&quot;&gt;Ordering a second alternator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So off to RockAuto I went, ordering ANOTHER 13107N alternator for a 78-80 Ford Fiesta. I think I ordered it on Friday, had a predicted delivery date of Monday, but was delivered Sunday morning. After washing and cleaning one of the cars Sunday morning I got to work on the Triumph again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seriously considered taking the new alternator to Autozone to test it out BEFORE I did anything to it, but went ahead and began the process of clocking it. This time however, things went differently. When I pulled it apart I immediately noticed two pieces down inside that stuck out and ultimately blocked the shaft of the alternator from being reinserted. They looked awfully familiar, just like the broken piece of randomness I found after clocking the other new alternator. What I figured out was that I had apparently broken those bits off in the first new alternator, though I only found one piece, not two from that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Picture of voltage regulator brushes, not from a Triumph alternator, just a screengrab from a YouTube video&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-7-800-65f00dc63.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of voltage regulator brushes, not from a Triumph alternator, just a screengrab from a YouTube video&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-7-200-65f00dc63.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-7-400-65f00dc63.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-7-800-65f00dc63.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-7-1600-65f00dc63.jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-7-2000-65f00dc63.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this time around I made sure not to break those off, I think they are brushes, they ultimately are part of the voltage regulator and press up against part of the copper shaft when the alternator is spinning. I ended up having to take the voltage regulator off the back of the case, tie a string around those two spring loaded brushes to push them back into their position and hold them in place. I then reinserted the voltage regulator, finished clocking the body and then cut/removed the string. This allowed the brushes so go back in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there the process was really straightforward, reinstall the alternator, plug things in and see how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I put the new alternator in, hooked up the wires and the belt, I started the car. The ignition light was on, and then fairly quickly went off. A quick check of the back of the alternator with a multimeter also showed a higher voltage coming from the alternator than the battery was sending!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of last items for anyone who stumbles on this post when working on their 1975 Triumph TR6 alternator. The alternator actually has 3 wires, though you’ll see above in the pictures that I only have two hooked up, and I only had 2 hooked up on the lucas alternator that I pulled out. The third wire is another 12V, I believe that third wire was used on the OEM alternator, but on newer units it isn’t required. The wire was just sitting free in the engine bay as seen in the photo below. I will tie it off to keep it safely not connected to anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Third wire for TR6 alternator&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-4-800-6b7174036.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Third wire for TR6 alternator&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-4-200-6b7174036.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-4-400-6b7174036.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-4-800-6b7174036.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/July/TR6Alternator/TR6Alternator-4-1500-6b7174036.jpg 1500w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extra-alternators&quot;&gt;Extra alternators?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I have a couple of alternators sitting around the garage. I figure if I can order a new voltage regulator I can repair the 13107N that hasn’t been used. I’ll also hold on to the Lucas unit in case I need to CORE that at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the car is running again I need to get it inspected so I can get plates on it and drive it around town!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Recap of the 2024 St. Louis CAM Challenge Autocross</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the thrill of autocross took over the Family Arena in St. Charles, Missouri, with the 2024 St. Louis CAM Challenge event. Competitors in various classes including CAM (Classic American Muscle) and others like XA/XB and Club Spec battled it out on the asphalt for top honors in both class competition and the challenge rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-cam-challenge-works&quot;&gt;How the CAM Challenge Works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAM Challenge follows a structured format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday Morning &amp;amp; Afternoon Runs&lt;/strong&gt;: Each car in classes like CAM-C, where I competed, gets 3 attempts in the morning. Due to time constraints and weather issues onsite, the afternoon runs were reduced to just 2 attempts per driver. The best times from these runs are combined for the class competition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday Qualifying &amp;amp; Challenge Rounds&lt;/strong&gt;: Another set of 3 runs on Sunday morning determines who makes it to the challenge rounds in the afternoon, with the top performers moving forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Autocross/STL-CAM-Challenge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-1-800-e3f530297.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Elizabeth Whitwork, CAM-C Ladies 2012 Mustang GT&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-1-200-e3f530297.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-1-400-e3f530297.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-1-800-e3f530297.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-1-1600-e3f530297.jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-1-2000-e3f530297.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-experience-in-cam-c&quot;&gt;My Experience in CAM-C&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving the &lt;strong&gt;Solo Performance Specialties 2012 Mustang GT&lt;/strong&gt;, I started strong. Despite a cone penalty which invalidated my potentially leading run of 42.178 seconds on Saturday morning, I finished in 5th place with a clean 42.938 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon session showed significant improvement, despite being shortened. I clinched a 4th place finish in class with a clean run of 41.832 seconds, overcoming previous cone penalties and positioning myself well for Sundayâ€™s challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Autocross/STL-CAM-Challenge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-2-800-edba6ef28.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Adam Buffa Toyota Supra&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-2-200-edba6ef28.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-2-400-edba6ef28.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-2-800-edba6ef28.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-2-1600-edba6ef28.jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-2-2000-edba6ef28.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sundays-strategic-runs&quot;&gt;Sunday’s Strategic Runs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualifying on Sunday was crucial. I led with a 41.831 on my first run and opted out of a third run after a slightly slower second attempt, saving the wear on our Bridgestone tires. This decision paid off, securing my place in the top 16 without additional risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Autocross/STL-CAM-Challenge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-3-800-99dd872ac.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Subaru WRX&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-3-200-99dd872ac.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-3-400-99dd872ac.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-3-800-99dd872ac.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-3-1600-99dd872ac.jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-3-2000-99dd872ac.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenge-rounds-the-fight-for-the-top-spots&quot;&gt;Challenge Rounds: The Fight for the Top Spots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the elimination rounds, efficiency was key. I managed a 41.914 in the first round, advancing without taking a second run. The format shifted in subsequent rounds, with each driver getting only one chance to make their mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second round, I clocked a time of 41.434, which was not as fast as I hoped, but it was enough to move me into the final round. Dave, Mike Leeder, and John Ward also advanced with impressive times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Autocross/STL-CAM-Challenge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-4-800-c49f1171e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Emily, Mazda Miata&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-4-200-c49f1171e.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-4-400-c49f1171e.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-4-800-c49f1171e.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-4-1600-c49f1171e.jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-4-2000-c49f1171e.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-high-stakes-final-round&quot;&gt;The High-Stakes Final Round&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final was intense. An error in the first right-hand turn after the slalom led to a cone strike and a critical decision to ease off to preserve the tires for Dave’s run. Although I finished the course leisurely, ensuring no additional strain on the car, the final round did not go as planned, and I did not actually complete the course correctly, which should have resulted in a DNF, but it was not called in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.rainbowmarks.com/2024/Autocross/STL-CAM-Challenge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-5-800-3a8fac79e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chris Lybarger C6 Corvette&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-5-200-3a8fac79e.jpg 200w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-5-400-3a8fac79e.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-5-800-3a8fac79e.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-5-1600-3a8fac79e.jpg 1600w, /assets/images_out/2024/May/CAMChallenge/CAMChallenge-5-2000-3a8fac79e.jpg 2000w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-performers&quot;&gt;Top Performers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAM-C Challenge, Mike Leeder took the top spot, followed by Dave Whitworth and John Ward. On the ladies’ side, remarkable performances were seen from Beth Whitworth and Cindy Duncan in the CAM-Ladies challenge, with Beth taking her first challenge win in an inspiring display of skill and determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 CAM Challenge in St. Louis was a memorable event filled with competitive spirit, strategic driving, and communal support among autocross enthusiasts. Congratulations to all participants, especially to those who reached new personal bests and to Beth for her outstanding achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
