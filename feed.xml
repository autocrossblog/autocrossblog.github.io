        <title>Hello World, AutocrossBlog.com is live!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;AutocrossBlog.com is a culmination of two decades of autocrossing and way too many different cars and car websites over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to consolidate my car blogs into this one location, I am sure there’s a broken link or two, but this is a good enough start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be blogging here going forward for all my automotive autocross adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2024 I’ll be back racing in St. Louis and around the Midwest with my good friend Dave Whitworth from &lt;a href=&quot;https://soloperformance.com/&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Project350z 20 Years Ago Today</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;20 Years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been 20 years since I picked up the 350z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know where it is, I wish I still owned it. Maybe one day Dozzle will let me buy it back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are photos from the day I purchased the car. Actually, this was the day I picked up the car, I went back the next day to sign the papers. I had a date (first date) and the paperwork was taking too long, so Todd (at Bommarito Nissan) told me to come back the next day rather than miss the date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last photo is of the 99 Z-28 that I traded in that day for the 350Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images_out/April2003/April2003-1-800-14d426070.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/assets/images_out/April2003/April2003-1-400-14d426070.jpg 400w, /assets/images_out/April2003/April2003-1-600-14d426070.jpg 600w, /assets/images_out/April2003/April2003-1-800-14d426070.jpg 800w, /assets/images_out/April2003/April2003-1-1000-14d426070.jpg 1000w&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Looking for another 240z</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking for a Datsun 240z in St. Louis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re selling a project, be sure to let me know! &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:240z@christoc.com&quot;&gt;240z@christoc.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1973 Datsun 240Z, also known as the Nissan Fairlady Z in Japan, is a classic sports car that gained popularity for its sleek design, impressive performance, and affordability. Here is a summary of the car’s history, design, and production details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Datsun 240Z was first introduced in 1969 as a 1970 model, marking the beginning of a line of successful sports cars from Datsun, a subsidiary of Nissan. It was designed to appeal to the American market and was influenced by European sports cars of the era. The 240Z quickly gained a reputation for its powerful performance, striking looks, and accessible price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 240Z showcased a timeless design that combined elements of a classic sports car with a touch of Japanese styling. Its long hood, short rear deck, and low-slung profile gave it a dynamic and aerodynamic appearance. The sleek body featured flowing lines, a prominent grille, and rounded headlights. The interior provided a driver-focused cockpit with comfortable seating, intuitive controls, and sufficient legroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;engine-and-performance&quot;&gt;Engine and Performance:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the 1973 240Z featured a 2.4-liter inline-six engine, hence the name 240Z, delivering around 151 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. This engine was known for its smooth power delivery and responsiveness. It was paired with a four-speed manual transmission or an optional three-speed automatic. The 240Z boasted impressive acceleration, excellent handling, and a top speed of around 125 mph (201 km/h), making it a thrilling driving experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;production-numbers&quot;&gt;Production Numbers:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During its production run from 1970 to 1973, Datsun manufactured a total of 30,938 240Z cars for the U.S. market. These numbers include all model years, so it is difficult to pinpoint the exact production figures for the 1973 model alone. However, the 240Z’s overall popularity and high demand contributed to its significant production numbers, making it a successful and iconic sports car of its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1973 Datsun 240Z remains highly regarded by enthusiasts and collectors today for its timeless design, engaging driving experience, and historical significance as one of the pioneers of Japanese sports cars.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why you should autocross</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Autocross is an exciting and challenging motorsport that is quickly gaining popularity among car enthusiasts. It is a competitive event where drivers navigate a course that is laid out on a large parking lot or closed-off airfield. The objective is to complete the course in the fastest time possible, while navigating tight turns, hairpin bends, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.specfrs.com/autocross-accident-why-you-need-autocross-insurance&quot;&gt;other obstacles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about autocross is that it is accessible to a wide range of drivers. Whether you are a seasoned pro or a beginner, there is a class for you. This means that you can compete against drivers of similar skill levels, which makes for a fair and enjoyable competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about autocross is that it is relatively inexpensive. All you need is a car, some safety gear, and a desire to have fun. You do not need a high-powered or expensive racecar to participate. Many people use their daily drivers, which keeps the cost of entry low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things you need to participate in autocross is a good set of tires. Tires are the only point of contact between your car and the ground, and they play a crucial role in your car’s performance. Good tires will provide better traction, which will help you navigate the course faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to buy your autocross supplies, including tires. They have a wide range of tires that are specifically designed for autocross, so you can be sure that you are getting the best possible product. They also offer a variety of other autocross supplies such as suspension upgrades, brakes, and other performance parts that can help you to improve your car’s performance on the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing high-quality autocross supplies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt; also offers great customer service.

They also offer installation services, so you can have your new parts installed quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a fun and exciting motorsport that is accessible to a wide range of drivers, then autocross is definitely worth considering. It is a great way to push yourself and your car to the limit, and it is also a great way to meet new people and make friends.

        <title>Where to buy a race helmet in St. Louis?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a racing helmet in St. Louis Missouri, you should be looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soloperformance.com/&quot;&gt;Solo Performance Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPS has a large number of different helmet makes models and sizes that you can try on in their retail store. Here’s a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://soloperformance.com/pages/find-us-service-info&quot;&gt;visit their St Louis location&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-i-need-to-try-on-my-helmet&quot;&gt;Do I need to try on my helmet?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying on your helmet is important, you want to make sure what you select fits you properly, and is comfortable. You’ll be wearing it for a long time, so you want to make sure it’s comfortable. You also shouldn’t just buy the cheapest helmet you can find, but what you can afford. We’re talking about protecting your noggin, I assume that is important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-brand-helmet-do-i-need&quot;&gt;What brand helmet do I need?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand specifics will obviously vary, do you need/want the most expensive coolest looking helmet? Or do you need the one that does the job the best? My recommendation is you try on multiple brands and see which one feels best, and meets your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;can-i-buy-a-helmet-online&quot;&gt;Can I buy a helmet online?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely you can buy a helmet online. &lt;a href=&quot;https://soloperformance.com/collections/helmets-and-accessories&quot;&gt;SoloPerformance.com&lt;/a&gt; has one of the largest selections of helmets online, they sell hundreds of helmets a year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One Year Later</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I realized a couple of days ago that it had been 12 months since the FR-S met its unfortunate demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only autocrossed once since then, in Dave’s Mustang at the 2021 Solo Nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s going to change though. I’ve got the bug. I need to find a ride. I need a project car, I need a toy. Sometime later this year the FR-S will be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FR-S ended up going north, I think towards Minneapolis. The guy who purchased it owns a body shop, I was told it would end up being a track car, but I haven’t seen any progress pictures on it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Parting out the Scion FR-S</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The time has finally come, time that I finally have, to try to start getting the 2016 Scion FR-S parted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got the car unburried from the smaller side of the garage and pulled it into the bigger 2 car bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, I got the car up on jackstands, after finding the wheel lock, and took the Konig wheels off the car. David Z picked those up from me yesterday afternoon, so the wheel and tires from the car are gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up I will be taking the SSC suspension bits, and the nameless exhaust, and replace them with the OEM parts. Once I have those off, hopefully in the next week, I’ll be selling those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things I need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;need to get to the DMV and get the lean cleared off the title so I can easily part with the car/title.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decide how much of what was removed will be put back on the car (front/rear bumper, lights, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in any of the car, or SSC bits, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car is located in Wildwood Missouri, just outside of St. Louis. The motor has less than 45k miles on it and runs great.&lt;/p&gt;
